  abstract = {Traffic sign recognition(TSR) based on deep learning is rapidly developing. Specifically, TSR contains two technologies, namely, traffic sign classification (TSC) and traffic sign detection (TSD). However, the challenge of TSR is to ensure its efficiency, which means adequate accuracy, generalization, and speed in real-time by a computationally limited platform. In this paper, we will introduce a new efficient TSC network called ENet (efficient network) and a TSD network called EmdNet (efficient network using multiscale operation and depthwise separable convolution). We used data mining and multiscale operation to improve the accuracy and generalization ability and used depthwise separable convolution (DSC) to improve the speed. The resulting ENet possesses 0.9 M parameters (1/15 the parameters of the start-of-the-art method) while still achieving an accuracy of 98.6 \% on the German Traffic Sign Recognition benchmark (GTSRB). In addition, we design EmdNet' s backbone network according to the principles of ENet. The EmdNet with the SDD Framework possesses only 6.3 M parameters, which is similar to MobileNet's scale.},

Though achieving high success rate in lab tests and limited field tests, such attacks have not been tested on multiple DNN architectures with a standard setup to unveil the common robustness and weakness points of both the DNNs and the attacks. Furthermore, realistic looking stickers applied by normal people as acts of vandalism are not studied to discover their potential risks as well the risk of optimizing the location of such realistic stickers to achieve the maximum performance drop. In this paper, (a) we study the case of realistic looking sticker application effects on traffic sign detectors performance; (b) we use traffic sign image classification as our use case and train and attack 11 of the modern architectures for our analysis; (c) by considering different factors like brightness, blurriness and contrast of the train images in our sticker application procedure, we show that simple image processing techniques can help realistic looking stickers fit into their background to mimic real world tests; (d) by performing structured synthetic and real-world evaluations, we study the difference of various traffic sign classes in terms of their crucial distinctive features among the tested DNNs.},

  abstract = {Introduction: Digital health is rapidly expanding due to surging healthcare costs, deteriorating health outcomes, and the growing prevalence and accessibility of mobile health (mHealth) and wearable technology. Data from Biometric Monitoring Technologies (BioMeTs), including mHealth and wearables, can be transformed into digital biomarkers that act as indicators of health outcomes and can be used to diagnose and monitor a number of chronic diseases and conditions. There are many challenges faced by digital biomarker development, including a lack of regulatory oversight, limited funding opportunities, general mistrust of sharing personal data, and a shortage of open-source data and code. Further, the process of transforming data into digital biomarkers is computationally expensive, and standards and validation methods in digital biomarker research are lacking. Methods: In order to provide a collaborative, standardized space for digital biomarker research and validation, we present the first comprehensive, open-source software platform for end-to-end digital biomarker development: The Digital Biomarker Discovery Pipeline (DBDP). Results: Here, we detail the general DBDP framework as well as three robust modules within the DBDP that have been developed for specific digital biomarker discovery use cases. Conclusions: The clear need for such a platform will accelerate the DBDP's adoption as the industry standard for digital biomarker development and will support its role as the epicenter of digital biomarker collaboration and exploration.},

  abstract = {Smartphones have become increasingly popular in recent years. However, it may be addiction-prone and result in negative outcomes. Given that relevant research remains limited, this study attempts to address two research gaps in the extant information systems literature. First, research on the determinants of smartphone addiction remains scarce. Second, the role of individual characteristics (i.e., gender) in the formation of smartphone addiction is far from clear. To fill these research gaps, this study develops a research model of smartphone addiction from the functionalist perspective and highlights the moderating role of gender with the insight of social orientation. We propose four categories of motives, including enhancement (i.e., perceived enjoyment), social (i.e., social relationship), coping (i.e., mood regulation and pastime), and conformity motives (i.e., conformity). Empirical results from our online survey illustrate that perceived enjoyment, mood regulation, pastime, and conformity positively affect smartphone addiction, whereas social relationship has no significant effect. Moreover, we find that gender moderates the effects of perceived enjoyment, pastime, and conformity on smartphone addiction. We expect that this study can enrich the theoretical understanding of how motives play different roles in the development of smartphone addiction. Implications are offered for both research and practice.},

This controversial topic has drawn great attention in public. However, we are still at a stage of divergent opinions without any definitive conclusion. Motivated by this, we raise the research question of ``is GPT-4 a good data analyst?'' in this work and aim to answer it by conducting head-to-head comparative studies. In detail, we regard GPT-4 as a data analyst to perform end-to-end data analysis with databases from a wide range of domains. We propose a framework to tackle the problems by carefully designing the prompts for GPT-4 to conduct experiments. We also design several task-specific evaluation metrics to systematically compare the performance between several professional human data analysts and GPT-4. Experimental results show that GPT-4 can achieve comparable performance to humans. We also provide in-depth discussions about our results to shed light on further studies before we reach the conclusion that GPT-4 can replace data analysts.

  abstract = {State-of-the-art object detectors usually progressively downsample the input image until it is represented by small feature maps, which loses the spatial information and compromises the representation of small objects. In this article, we propose a context-aware block net (CAB Net) to improve small object detection by building high-resolution and strong semantic feature maps. To internally enhance the representation capacity of feature maps with high spatial resolution, we delicately design the context-aware block (CAB). CAB exploits pyramidal dilated convolutions to incorporate multilevel contextual information without losing the original resolution of feature maps. Then, we assemble CAB to the end of the truncated backbone network (e.g., VGG16) with a relatively small downsampling factor (e.g., 8) and cast off all following layers. CAB Net can capture both basic visual patterns as well as semantical information of small objects, thus improving the performance of small object detection. Experiments conducted on the benchmark Tsinghua-Tencent 100K and the Airport dataset show that CAB Net outperforms other top-performing detectors by a large margin while keeping real-time speed, which demonstrates the effectiveness of CAB Net for small object detection.},

  abstract = {Text data augmentation is an effective strategy for overcoming the challenge of limited sample sizes in many natural language processing (NLP) tasks. This challenge is especially prominent in the few-shot learning scenario, where the data in the target domain is generally much scarcer and of lowered quality. A natural and widely-used strategy to mitigate such challenges is to perform data augmentation to better capture the data invariance and increase the sample size. However, current text data augmentation methods either can't ensure the correct labeling of the generated data (lacking faithfulness) or can't ensure sufficient diversity in the generated data (lacking compactness), or both. Inspired by the recent success of large language models, especially the development of ChatGPT, which demonstrated improved language comprehension abilities, in this work, we propose a text data augmentation approach based on ChatGPT (named AugGPT). AugGPT rephrases each sentence in the training samples into multiple conceptually similar but semantically different samples. The augmented samples can then be used in downstream model training. Experiment results on few-shot learning text classification tasks show the superior performance of the proposed AugGPT approach over state-of-the-art text data augmentation methods in terms of testing accuracy and distribution of the augmented samples.},

Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) studies can capture fluctuations in momentary behavior, and experiences by assessing these multiple times per day. Traditionally, EMA was performed using pen and paper. Recently, due to technological advances EMA studies can be conducted more easily with smartphones, a device ubiquitous in our society. The goal of this review was to evaluate the literature on smartphone-based EMA in well-being research in healthy subjects. The systematic review was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines. Searching PubMed and Web of Science, we identified 53 studies using smartphone-based EMA of wellbeing. Studies were heterogeneous in designs, context, and measures. The average study duration was 12.8 days, with well-being assessed 2\textendash 12 times per day. Half of the studies included objective data (e.g. location). Only 47.2\% reported compliance, indicating a mean of 71.6\%. Well-being fluctuated daily and weekly, with higher well-being in evenings and weekends. These fluctuations disappeared when location and activity were accounted for. On average, being in nature and physical activity relates to higher well-being. Working relates to lower well-being, but workplace and company do influence well-being. The important advantages of using smartphones instead of other devices to collect EMAs are the easier data collection and flexible designs. Smartphone-based EMA reach far larger maximum sample sizes and more easily add objective data to their designs than palm-top/ PDA studies. Smartphone-based EMA research is feasible to gain insight in well-being fluctuations and its determinants and offers the opportunity for parallel objective data collection. Most studies currently focus on group comparisons, while studies on individual differences in well-being patterns and fluctuations are lacking. We provide recommendations for future smartphone-based EMA research regarding measures, objective data and analyses.},

The dataset determines the quality of the complete visual system based on CNN. Unfortunately, databases for traffic signs from the majority of the world's nations are few. In this scenario, Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) may be employed to produce more realistic and varied training pictures to supplement the actual arrangement of images. The purpose of this research is to describe how the quality of synthetic pictures created by DCGAN, LSGAN, and WGAN is determined. Our work combines synthetic images with original images to enhance datasets and verify the effectiveness of synthetic datasets. We use different numbers and sizes of images for training. Likewise, the Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) and Mean Square Error (MSE) were employed to assess picture quality. Our study quantifies the SSIM difference between the synthetic and actual images. When additional images are used for training, the synthetic image exhibits a high degree of resemblance to the genuine image. The highest SSIM value was achieved when using 200 total images as input and 32 \texttimes{} 32 image size. Further, we augment the original picture dataset with synthetic pictures and compare the original image model to the synthesis image model. For this experiment, we are using the latest iterations of Yolo, Yolo V3, and Yolo V4. After mixing the real image with the synthesized image produced by LSGAN, the recognition performance has been improved, achieving an accuracy of 84.9\% on Yolo V3 and an accuracy of 89.33\% on Yolo V4.},

  abstract = {The recent advancements in Artificial Intelligence, particularly in large language models and generative models, are reshaping the field of software engineering by enabling innovative ways of performing various tasks, such as programming, debugging, and testing. However, few existing works have thoroughly explored the potential of AI in code generation and users' attitudes toward AI-assisted coding tools. This knowledge gap leaves it unclear how AI is transforming software engineering and programming education. This paper presents a scalable crowdsourcing data-driven framework to investigate the code generation performance of generative large language models from diverse perspectives across multiple social media platforms. Specifically, we utilize ChatGPT, a popular generative large language model, as a representative example to reveal its insights and patterns in code generation. First, we propose a hybrid keyword word expansion method that integrates words suggested by topic modeling and expert knowledge to filter relevant social posts of interest on Twitter and Reddit. Then we collect 316K tweets and 3.2K Reddit posts about ChatGPT's code generation, spanning from Dec. 1, 2022 to January 31, 2023. Our data analytics show that ChatGPT has been used in more than 10 programming languages, with Python and JavaScript being the two most popular, for a diverse range of tasks such as code debugging, interview preparation, and academic assignment solving. Surprisingly, our analysis shows that fear is the dominant emotion associated with ChatGPT's code generation, overshadowing emotions of happiness, anger, surprise, and sadness. Furthermore, we construct a ChatGPT prompt and corresponding code dataset by analyzing the screenshots of ChatGPT code generation shared on social media. This dataset enables us to evaluate the quality of the generated code, and we have released this dataset to the public. We believe the insights gained from our work will provide valuable guidance for future research on AI-powered code generation.},

  abstract = {The Indoor Air Quality (IAQ) of the bedroom environment has recently garnered attention since air pollution can affect sleep. Previous studies investigated IAQ and sleep quality in controlled environments which impacts both self-reported and measured sleep quality. Studies within a participant's home environment are ecologically valid and reduce participant bias. Here, we study 20 participants over 77 days in Austin, TX. We monitored five components of IAQ using the BEVO Beacon, a calibrated purpose-built environmental monitor, and measured participant sleep quality through wearable activity trackers and 4-question surveys sent four times a week. We found significant decreases in sleep quality during nights with elevated CO, CO2, and temperature. Elevated CO was associated with a mean increase in 0.9 self-reported awakenings and decreases in device-measured sleep time of 21.6 min and sleep efficiency of 0.6\%. Increased CO2 and temperature were associated with decreases in device-measured sleep time of 17.5 and 15.2 min, respectively. Elevated PM2.5 and TVOCs concentrations were associated with overall improvements in sleep quality. Participants reported a mean of 4.4 fewer awakenings and had a 1.1\% increased in measured sleep efficiency for nights with elevated PM2.5. Elevated TVOCs were associated with an increase in sleep time of 14.5 min. These findings indicate a need to study the relationship between these aggregate IAQ measures and sleep quality more closely. Our results also indicate that pollutants can independently affect sleep quality regardless of the CO2 measurements. Compared to literature, our study is the longest and includes the most IAQ parameters.},

  abstract = {A variety of factors can affect a person's perception of their environment and health, but one factor that is often overlooked in indoor settings is the air quality. To address this gap, we develop and evaluate four Machine Learning (ML) models on two disparate datasets using Indoor Air Quality (IAQ) parameters as primary features and components of self-reported IAQ satisfaction and sleep quality as target variables. In each case, we compare models to each other as well as to a simple model that always predicts the majority outcome. In the first analysis, we use open-source data collected from 93 California residences to predict occupant's satisfaction with their indoor environ\- ment. Results indicate building ventilation rate, Relative Humidity (RH), and formaldehyde are most influential when predicting IAQ perception and do so with an accuracy greater than the simplified model. The second analysis uses IAQ data gathered from a field study we conducted with 20 participants over 11 weeks to train similar models. We obtain accuracy and F1 scores similar to the simplified model where PM2.5 and TVOCs represent the most important predictors. Our results underscore the ability of IAQ to affect a person's perception of their built environment and health and highlight the utility of ML models to explore the strength of these relationships.},

  abstract = {The rise of big data has amplified the need for efficient, user-friendly automated machine learning (AutoML) tools. However, the intricacy of understanding domain-specific data and defining prediction tasks necessitates human intervention making the process time-consuming while preventing full automation. Instead, envision an intelligent agent capable of assisting users in conducting AutoML tasks through intuitive, natural conversations without requiring in-depth knowledge of the underlying machine learning (ML) processes. This agent's key challenge is to accurately comprehend the user's prediction goals and, consequently, formulate precise ML tasks, adjust data sets and model parameters accordingly, and articulate results effectively. In this paper, we take a pioneering step towards this ambitious goal by introducing a ChatGPT-based conversational data-science framework to act as a "personal data scientist". Precisely, we utilize Large Language Models (ChatGPT) to build a natural interface between the users and the ML models (Scikit-Learn), which in turn, allows us to approach this ambitious problem with a realistic solution. Our model pivots around four dialogue states: Data Visualization, Task Formulation, Prediction Engineering, and Result Summary and Recommendation. Each state marks a unique conversation phase, impacting the overall user-system interaction. Multiple LLM instances, serving as "micro-agents", ensure a cohesive conversation flow, granting us granular control over the conversation's progression. In summary, we developed an end-to-end system that not only proves the viability of the novel concept of conversational data science but also underscores the potency of LLMs in solving complex tasks. Interestingly, its development spotlighted several critical weaknesses in the current LLMs (ChatGPT) and highlighted substantial opportunities for improvement.},

  abstract = {ChatGPT, a conversational AI interface that utilizes natural language processing and machine learning algorithms, is taking the world by storm and is the buzzword across many sectors today. Given the likely impact of this model on data science, through this perspective article, we seek to provide an overview of the potential opportunities and challenges associated with using ChatGPT in data science, provide readers with a snapshot of its advantages, and stimulate interest in its use for data science projects. The paper discusses how ChatGPT can assist data scientists in automating various aspects of their workflow, including data cleaning and preprocessing, model training, and result interpretation. It also highlights how ChatGPT has the potential to provide new insights and improve decision-making processes by analyzing unstructured data. We then examine the advantages of ChatGPT's architecture, including its ability to be fine-tuned for a wide range of language-related tasks and generate synthetic data. Limitations and issues are also addressed, particularly around concerns about bias and plagiarism when using ChatGPT. Overall, the paper concludes that the benefits outweigh the costs and ChatGPT has the potential to greatly enhance the productivity and accuracy of data science workflows and is likely to become an increasingly important tool for intelligence augmentation in the field of data science. ChatGPT can assist with a wide range of natural language processing tasks in data science, including language translation, sentiment analysis, and text classification. However, while ChatGPT can save time and resources compared to training a model from scratch, and can be fine-tuned for specific use cases, it may not perform well on certain tasks if it has not been specifically trained for them. Additionally, the output of ChatGPT may be difficult to interpret, which could pose challenges for decision-making in data science applications.},

However, owing to the huge amount of parameters that need to be learned and to the complex nature of HSI data itself, these approaches must deal with the important problem of overfitting, which can lead to inadequate generalization and loss of accuracy. In order to mitigate this problem, in this letter, we adopt random occlusion, a recently developed data augmentation (DA) method for training CNNs, in which the pixels of different rectangular spatial regions in the HSI are randomly occluded, generating training images with various levels of occlusion and reducing the risk of overfitting. Our results with two well-known HSIs reveal that the proposed method helps to achieve better classification accuracy with low computational cost.},

A broad range of prior research has investigated the spatial component of this relationship, seeking to strengthen the representational power of a CNN by enhancing the quality of spatial encodings throughout its feature hierarchy. In this work, we focus instead on the channel relationship and propose a novel architectural unit, which we term the ``Squeeze-and-Excitation'' (SE) block, that adaptively recalibrates channel-wise feature responses by explicitly modelling interdependencies between channels. We show that these blocks can be stacked together to form SENet architectures that generalise extremely effectively across different datasets. We further demonstrate that SE blocks bring significant improvements in performance for existing state-of-the-art CNNs at slight additional computational cost. Squeeze-and-Excitation Networks formed the foundation of our ILSVRC 2017 classification submission which won first place and reduced the top-5 error to 2.251\%, surpassing the winning entry of 2016 by a relative improvement of {$\sim$}25\%.

However, it is a challenging task because of the complex traffic sign scene and the small size of the target. In recent years, a number of convolutional neural network (CNN) based object detection methods have brought great progress to traffic sign detection. Considering the still high false detection rate, as well as the high time overhead and computational overhead, the effect is not satisfactory. Therefore, we employ lightweight network model YOLO v5 (You Only Look Once) as our work foundation. In this paper, we propose an improved YOLO v5 method by using balances feature pyramid structure and global context block to enhance the ability of feature fusion and feature extraction. To verify our proposed method, we have conducted a lot of comparative experiments on the challenging dataset Tsinghua-Tencent-100K (TT100K).

  abstract = {Feature pyramids are a basic component in recognition systems for detecting objects at different scales. But recent deep learning object detectors have avoided pyramid representations, in part because they are compute and memory intensive. In this paper, we exploit the inherent multi-scale, pyramidal hierarchy of deep convolutional networks to construct feature pyramids with marginal extra cost. A topdown architecture with lateral connections is developed for building high-level semantic feature maps at all scales. This architecture, called a Feature Pyramid Network (FPN), shows significant improvement as a generic feature extractor in several applications. Using FPN in a basic Faster R-CNN system, our method achieves state-of-the-art singlemodel results on the COCO detection benchmark without bells and whistles, surpassing all existing single-model entries including those from the COCO 2016 challenge winners. In addition, our method can run at 5 FPS on a GPU and thus is a practical and accurate solution to multi-scale object detection. Code will be made publicly available.},

  abstract = {Traffic sign recognition is critical for advanced driver assistant system and road infrastructure survey. Traditional traffic sign recognition algorithms can't efficiently recognize traffic signs due to its limitation, yet deep learning-based technique requires huge amount of training data before its use, which is time consuming and labor intensive. In this study, transfer learning-based method is introduced for traffic sign recognition and classification, which significantly reduces the amount of training data and alleviates computation expense using Inception-v3 model. In our experiment, Belgium Traffic Sign Database is chosen and augmented by data pre-processing technique. Subsequently the layer-wise features extracted using different convolution and pooling operations are compared and analyzed. Finally transfer learning-based model is repetitively retrained several times with fine-tuning parameters at different learning rate, and excellent reliability and repeatability are observed based on statistical analysis. The results show that transfer learning model can achieve a high-level recognition performance in traffic sign recognition, which is up to 99.18 \% of recognition accuracy at 0.05 learning rate (average accuracy of 99.09 \%). This study would be beneficial in other traffic infrastructure recognition such as road lane marking and roadside protection facilities, and so on.},

However, AI is an unavoidable trend in education that has the potential to subvert many courses' pedagogical structure and methods. One such course is financial data science with Python programming, a course that is in high demand among finance majors. Incorporating ChatGPT into such a course can solve longstanding challenges and difficulties that instructors and students are facing, and it can shift the focus of the course from tedious Python coding back to financial data interpretations and real-world applications. This paper represents a first attempt at welcoming ChatGPT into financial education, by focusing on the pedagogical innovation of a financial data science course with Python programming.

As the first key step of TSR, traffic sign detection (TSD) is a challenging problem because of different types, small sizes, complex driving scenes, and occlusions. In recent years, there have been a large number of TSD algorithms based on machine vision and pattern recognition. In this paper, a comprehensive review of the literature on TSD is presented. We divide the reviewed detection methods into five main categories: color-based methods, shape-based methods, color- and shape-based methods, machine-learning-based methods, and LIDAR-based methods. The methods in each category are also classified into different subcategories for understanding and summarizing the mechanisms of different methods. For some reviewed methods that lack comparisons on public datasets, we reimplemented part of these methods for comparison. The experimental comparisons and analyses are presented on the reported performance and the performance of our reimplemented methods. Furthermore, future directions and recommendations of the TSD research are given to promote the development of the TSD.},

  abstract = {Small traffic sign recognition is a challenging problem in computer vision, and its accuracy is important to the safety of intelligent transportation systems (ITS). In this paper, we propose the multiscale region-based convolutional neural network (MR-CNN). At the detection stage, MR-CNN uses a multiscale deconvolution operation to up-sample the features of the deeper convolution layers and concatenates them to those of the shallow layer to construct the fused feature map. The fused feature map has the ability to generate fewer region proposals and achieve higher recall values. At the classification stage, we leverage the multi-scale contextual regions to exploit the information surrounding a given object proposal and construct the fused feature for the fully connected layers. The fused feature map inside the region proposal network (RPN) focuses primarily on improving the image resolution and semantic information for small traffic sign detection, while outside the RPN, the fused feature enhances the feature representation by leveraging the contextual information. Finally, we evaluated MR-CNN on the largest dataset, TsinghuaTencent 100K, which is suitable for our problem and more challenging than the GTSDB and GTSRB datasets. The final experimental results indicate that the MR-CNN is superior at detecting small traffic signs, and that it achieves the state-of-the-art performance compared with other methods.},

  abstract = {Traffic sign detection and recognition in the wild is a challenging task. Existing techniques are often incapable of detecting small or occluded traffic signs because of the scale variation and context loss, which causes semantic gaps between multiple scales. We propose a new traffic sign detection network (TSingNet), which learns scale-aware and context-rich features to effectively detect and recognize small and occluded traffic signs in the wild. Specifically, TSingNet first constructs an attention-driven bilateral feature pyramid network, which draws on both bottom-up and top-down subnets to dually circulate low-, mid-, and high-level foreground semantics in scale self-attention learning. This is to learn scaleaware foreground features and thus narrow down the semantic gaps between multiple scales. An adaptive receptive field fusion block with variable dilation rates is then introduced to exploit context-rich representation and suppress the influence of occlusion at each scale. TSingNet is end-to-end trainable by joint minimization of the scale-aware loss and multi-branch fusion losses, this adds a few parameters but significantly improves the detection performance. In extensive experiments with three challenging traffic sign datasets (TT100K, STSD and DFG), TSingNet outperformed state-of-the-art methods for traffic sign detection and recognition in the wild.},

  abstract = {Traditional camera sensors rely on human eyes for observation. However, the human eye is prone to fatigue when observing targets of different sizes for a long time in complex scenes, and human cognition is limited, which often leads to judgment errors and greatly reduces the efficiency. Target recognition technology is an important technology to judge the target category in camera sensor. In order to solve this problem, a small size target detection algorithm for special scenarios was proposed by this paper. Its advantage is that this algorithm not only has higher precision for small size target detection, but also can ensure that the detection accuracy of each size is not lower than the existing algorithm. In this paper, a new down-sampling method was proposed, which could better preserve the context feature information. The feature fusion network was improved to effectively combine shallow information and deep information. A new network structure was proposed to effectively improve the detection accuracy of the model. In terms of accuracy, it is better than: YOLOX, YOLOXR, YOLOv3, scaled YOLOv5, YOLOv7-Tiny and YOLOv8.Three authoritative public data sets were used in this experiment: a) On Visdron data sets (small size targets), DC-YOLOv8 is 2.5\% more accurate than YOLOv8. b) On Tinyperson data sets (minimal size targets), DC-YOLOv8 is 1\% more accurate than YOLOv8. c) On PASCAL VOC2007 data sets (Normal size target), DC-YOLOv8 is 0.5\% more accurate than YOLOv8.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES To examine the directional associations among motor activity, energy, mood, and sleep using mobile monitoring in a community-identified sample, and to evaluate whether these within-day associations differ between people with a history of bipolar or other mood disorders and controls without mood disorders. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This study used a nested case-control design of 242 adults, a subsample of a community-based sample of adults. Probands were recruited by mail from the greater Washington, DC, metropolitan area from January 2005 to June 2013. Enrichment of the sample for mood disorders was provided by volunteers or referrals from the National Institutes of Health Clinical Center or by participants in the National Institute of Mental Health Mood and Anxiety Disorders Program. The inclusion criteria were the ability to speak English, availability to participate, and consent to contact at least 2 living first-degree relatives. Data analysis was performed from June 2013 through July 2018. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Motor activity and sleep duration data were obtained from minute-to-minute activity counts from an actigraphy device worn on the nondominant wrist for 2 weeks. Mood and energy levels were assessed by subjective analogue ratings on the ecological momentary assessment (using a personal digital assistant) by participants 4 times per day for 2 weeks. RESULTS Of the total 242 participants, 92 (38.1\%) were men and 150 (61.9\%) were women, with a mean (SD) age of 48 (16.9) years. Among the participants, 54 (22.3\%) had bipolar disorder (25 with bipolar I; 29 with bipolar II), 91 (37.6\%) had major depressive disorder, and 97 (40.1\%) were controls with no history of mood disorders. A unidirectional association was found between motor activity and subjective mood level ({$\beta$} = \textendash 0.018, P = .04). Bidirectional associations were observed between motor activity ({$\beta$} = 0.176; P = .03) and subjective energy level ({$\beta$} = 0.027; P = .03) as well as between motor activity ({$\beta$} = \textendash 0.027; P = .04) and sleep duration ({$\beta$} = \textendash 0.154; P = .04). Greater cross-domain reactivity was observed in bipolar disorder across all outcomes, including motor activity, sleep, mood, and energy. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE These findings suggest that interventions focused on motor activity and energy may have greater efficacy than current approaches that target depressed mood; both active and passive tracking of multiple regulatory systems are important in designing therapeutic targets.},

Beiwe consists of two native front-end applications: one for Android (written in Java and Kotlin) and one for iOS (written in Swift and Objective-C). The Beiwe back-end, which is based on Amazon Web Services (AWS), has been implemented primarily in Python 3.6, but it also makes use of Django for ORM and Flask for API and web servers. It uses several AWS services, such as S3 for flat file storage, EC2 virtual servers for data processing, Elastic Beanstalk for orchestration, and RDS for PostgreSQL database engine. Most smartphone applications use software development kits (SDKs) that generate unvalidated behavioral summary measures using closed proprietary algorithms. These applications do not meet the high standards of reproducible science, and often require researchers to modify their scientific questions based on what data happens to be available. In contrast, Beiwe collects raw sensor and phone use data, and its data collection parameters can be customized to address specific scientific questions of interest. Collection of raw data also improves reproducibility of studies and enables re-analyses of data and pooling of data across studies. Every aspect of Beiwe data collection is fully customizable, including which sensors to sample, how frequently to sample them, whether to add Gaussian noise to GPS location, whether to use Wi-Fi or cellular data for uploads, how frequently to upload data, specification of surveys and their response options, and skip logic. All study settings are captured in a JSON-formatted configuration file, which can be exported from and imported to Beiwe to enhance transparency and reproducibility of studies.},

We propose to solve this problem by adding data analysis capabilities onto TigerAware, an existing data collection platform. TigerAware offers a generic and customizable tool which allows researchers without technical expertise to create, manage, and deploy custom mobile surveys to participants in real-time. We seek to add data analysis functionalities to the TigerAware platform ranging from basic statistics functions to emotion recognition via deep learning. Our analysis platform uses data collected by TigerAware to give researchers real-time analytics throughout the duration of their study. Through our additions to the TigerAware platform, we present a novel all-in-one tool for researchers to facilitate effective survey creation, survey administration, data collection, and data analysis.},

  abstract = {Assessment in clinical psychology typically relies on global retrospective self-reports collected at research or clinic visits, which are limited by recall bias and are not well suited to address how behavior changes over time and across contexts. Ecological momentary assessment (EMA) involves repeated sampling of subjects' current behaviors and experiences in real time, in subjects' natural environments. EMA aims to minimize recall bias, maximize ecological validity, and allow study of microprocesses that influence behavior in real-world contexts. EMA studies assess particular events in subjects' lives or assess subjects at periodic intervals, often by random time sampling, using technologies ranging from written diaries and telephones to electronic diaries and physiological sensors. We discuss the rationale for EMA, EMA designs, methodological and practical issues, and comparisons of EMA and recall data. EMA holds unique promise to advance the science and practice of clinical psychology by shedding light on the dynamics of behavior in real-world settings.},

Current state-of-the-art methods quantify physical activity using ``activity counts,'' a measure which overlooks specific types of physical activities. We propose a walking recognition method for sub-second tri-axial accelerometer data, in which activity classification is based on the inherent features of walking: intensity, periodicity, and duration. We validate our method against 20 publicly available, annotated datasets on walking activity data collected at various body locations (thigh, waist, chest, arm, wrist). We demonstrate that our method can estimate walking periods with high sensitivity and specificity: average sensitivity ranged between 0.92 and 0.97 across various body locations, and average specificity for common daily activities was typically above 0.95. We also assess the method's algorithmic fairness to demographic and anthropometric variables and measurement contexts (body location, environment). Finally, we release our method as open-source software in Python and MATLAB.},

Therefore, we need to carefully assess the capabilities and limitations of automated traffic sign detection systems. Existing traffic sign datasets are limited in terms of type and severity of challenging conditions. Metadata corresponding to these conditions are unavailable and it is not possible to investigate the effect of a single factor because of simultaneous changes in numerous conditions. To overcome the shortcomings in existing datasets, we introduced the CURE-TSDReal dataset, which is based on simulated challenging conditions that correspond to adversaries that can occur in real-world environments and systems. We test the performance of two benchmark algorithms and show that severe conditions can result in an average performance degradation of 29\% in precision and 68\% in recall. We investigate the effect of challenging conditions through spectral analysis and show that challenging conditions can lead to distinct magnitude spectrum characteristics. Moreover, we show that mean magnitude spectrum of changes in video sequences under challenging conditions can be an indicator of detection performance.

  abstract = {Background Smartwatch and fitness band wearable consumer electronics can passively measure pulse rate from the wrist using photoplethysmography (PPG). Identification of pulse irregularity or variability from these data has the potential to identify atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter (AF, collectively). The rapidly expanding consumer base of these devices allows for detection of undiagnosed AF at scale. Methods The Apple Heart Study is a prospective, single arm pragmatic study that has enrolled 419,093 participants (NCT03335800). The primary objective is to measure the proportion of participants with an irregular pulse detected by the Apple Watch (Apple Inc, Cupertino, CA) with AF on subsequent ambulatory ECG patch monitoring. The secondary objectives are to: 1) characterize the concordance of pulse irregularity notification episodes from the Apple Watch with simultaneously recorded ambulatory ECGs; 2) estimate the rate of initial contact with a health care provider within 3 months after notification of pulse irregularity. The study is conducted virtually, with screening, consent and data collection performed electronically from within an accompanying smartphone app. Study visits are performed by telehealth study physicians via video chat through the app, and ambulatory ECG patches are mailed to the participants. Conclusions The results of this trial will provide initial evidence for the ability of a smartwatch algorithm to identify pulse irregularity and variability which may reflect previously unknown AF. The Apple Heart Study will help provide a foundation for how wearable technology can inform the clinical approach to AF identification and screening. (Am Heart J 2019;207:66-75.)},

We deployed the app on the personal smartphones of 60 users and analyzed quantitative data collected in-the-wild and qualitative user-experience reports. The interface's flexibility was important to gain frequent, detailed labels, support diverse behavioral situations, and engage different users: most preferred reporting their past behavior through a daily journal, but some preferred reporting what they're about to do.

  abstract = {Smartphone and wearable devices are widely used in behavioral and clinical research to collect longitudinal data that, along with ground truth data, are used to create models of human behavior. Mobile sensing researchers often program data processing and analysis code from scratch even though many research teams collect data from similar mobile sensors, platforms, and devices. This leads to significant inefficiency in not being able to replicate and build on others' work, inconsistency in quality of code and results, and lack of transparency when code is not shared alongside publications. We provide an overview of Reproducible Analysis Pipeline for Data Streams (RAPIDS), a reproducible pipeline to standardize the preprocessing, feature extraction, analysis, visualization, and reporting of data streams coming from mobile sensors. RAPIDS is formed by a group of R and Python scripts that are executed on top of reproducible virtual environments, orchestrated by a workflow management system, and organized following a consistent file structure for data science projects. We share open source, documented, extensible and tested code to preprocess, extract, and visualize behavioral features from data collected with any Android or iOS smartphone sensing app as well as Fitbit and Empatica wearable devices. RAPIDS allows researchers to process mobile sensor data in a rigorous and reproducible way. This saves time and effort during the data analysis phase of a project and facilitates sharing analysis workflows alongside publications.},

A number of human-subject studies have been conducted to examine the use of mobile sensing to uncover individual behavioral patterns and health outcomes, yet minimal attention has been placed on measuring living environments together with other human-centered sensing data. Moreover, the participant sample size in most existing studies falls well below a few hundred, leaving questions open about the reliability of findings on the relations between mobile sensing signals and human outcomes.                                         Results               To address these limitations, we developed a home environment sensor kit for continuous indoor air quality tracking and deployed it in conjunction with smartphones, Fitbits, and ecological momentary assessments in a cohort study of up to 1,584 college student participants per data type for 3 weeks. We propose a conceptual framework that systematically organizes human-centric data modalities by their temporal coverage and spatial freedom. Then we report our study procedure, technologies and methods deployed, and descriptive statistics of the collected data that reflect the participants' mood, sleep, behavior, and living environment.

In this study, we explored the use of large language models (LLMs) in supporting deductive coding, a major category of qualitative analysis where researchers use pre-determined codebooks to label the data into a fixed set of codes. Instead of training task-specific models, a pre-trained LLM could be used directly for various tasks without fine-tuning through prompt learning. Using a curiosity-driven questions coding task as a case study, we found, by combining GPT-3 with expert-drafted codebooks, our proposed approach achieved fair to substantial agreements with expert-coded results. We lay out challenges and opportunities in using LLMs to support qualitative coding and beyond.},

  abstract = {Traffic sign recognition systems have been applied to advanced driving assistance and automatic driving systems to help drivers obtain important road information accurately. The current mainstream detection methods have high accuracy in this task, but the number of model parameters is large, and the detection speed is slow. Based on YOLOv5s as the basic framework, this paper proposes YOLOv5S-A2, which can improve the detection speed and reduce the model size at the cost of reducing the detection accuracy. Firstly, a data augmentation strategy is proposed by combining various operations to alleviate the problem of unbalanced class instances. Secondly, we proposed a path aggregation module for Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) to make new horizontal connections. It can enhance multi-scale feature representation capability and compensate for the loss of feature information. Thirdly, an attention detection head module is proposed to solve the aliasing effect in cross-scale fusion and enhance the representation of predictive features. Experiments on Tsinghua-Tencent 100K dataset (TT100K) show that our method can achieve more remarkable performance improvement and faster inference speed than other advanced technologies. Our method achieves 87.3\% mean average precision (mAP), surpassing the original model's 7.9\%, and the frames per second (FPS) value is maintained at 87.7. To show generality, we tested it on the German Traffic Sign Detection Benchmark (GTSDB) without tuning and obtained an average precision of 94.1\%, and the FPS value is maintained at about 105.3. In addition, the number of YOLOv5s-A2 parameters is about 7.9 M.},

  abstract = {Although promising results have been achieved in the areas of traffic-sign detection and classification, few works have provided simultaneous solutions to these two tasks for realistic real world images. We make two contributions to this problem. Firstly, we have created a large traffic-sign benchmark from 100000 Tencent Street View panoramas, going beyond previous benchmarks. It provides 100000 images containing 30000 traffic-sign instances. These images cover large variations in illuminance and weather conditions. Each traffic-sign in the benchmark is annotated with a class label, its bounding box and pixel mask. We call this benchmark Tsinghua-Tencent 100K. Secondly, we demonstrate how a robust end-to-end convolutional neural network (CNN) can simultaneously detect and classify trafficsigns. Most previous CNN image processing solutions target objects that occupy a large proportion of an image, and such networks do not work well for target objects occupying only a small fraction of an image like the traffic-signs here. Experimental results show the robustness of our network and its superiority to alternatives. The benchmark, source code and the CNN model introduced in this paper is publicly available1.},

  abstract = {Object detection, as of one the most fundamental and challenging problems in computer vision, has received great attention in recent years. Over the past two decades, we have seen a rapid technological evolution of object detection and its profound impact on the entire computer vision field. If we consider today's object detection technique as a revolution driven by deep learning, then back in the 1990s, we would see the ingenious thinking and long-term perspective design of early computer vision. This paper extensively reviews this fast-moving research field in the light of technical evolution, spanning over a quarter-century's time (from the 1990s to 2022). A number of topics have been covered in this paper, including the milestone detectors in history, detection datasets, metrics, fundamental building blocks of the detection system, speed-up techniques, and the recent state-of-the-art detection methods.},
