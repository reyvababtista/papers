  abstract = {Most counting questions in visual question answering (VQA) datasets are simple and require no more than object detection. Here, we study algorithms for complex counting questions that involve relationships between objects, attribute identification, reasoning, and more. To do this, we created TallyQA, the world's largest dataset for open-ended counting. We propose a new algorithm for counting that uses relation networks with region proposals. Our method lets relation networks be efficiently used with high-resolution imagery. It yields stateof-the-art results compared to baseline and recent systems on both TallyQA and the HowMany-QA benchmark.},

However, if these models are to ever function in the wild, a much larger variety of visual concepts must be learned, ideally from less supervision. To encourage the development of image captioning models that can learn visual concepts from alternative data sources, such as object detection datasets, we present the first large-scale benchmark for this task. Dubbed 'nocaps', for novel object captioning at scale, our benchmark consists of 166,100 human-generated captions describing 15,100 images from the OpenImages validation and test sets. The associated training data consists of COCO image-caption pairs, plus OpenImages image-level labels and object bounding boxes. Since OpenImages contains many more classes than COCO, nearly 400 object classes seen in test images have no or very few associated training captions (hence, nocaps). We extend existing novel object captioning models to establish strong baselines for this benchmark and provide analysis to guide future work on this task.},

A particularly exciting aspect of LLMs is their knack for few-shot and zero-shot learning: they can learn to perform a task with very few examples. Fewshotting has particular synergies in software engineering, where there are a lot of phenomena (identifier names, APIs, terminology, coding patterns) that are known to be highly project-specific. However, project-specific data can be quite limited, especially early in the history of a project; thus the few-shot learning capacity of LLMs might be very relevant. In this paper, we investigate the use few-shot training with the very large GPT (Generative Pretrained Transformer) Codex model, and find evidence suggesting that one can significantly surpass state-of-the-art models for codesummarization, leveraging project-specific training.},

We introduce Flamingo, a family of Visual Language Models (VLM) with this ability. We propose key architectural innovations to: (i) bridge powerful pretrained vision-only and language-only models, (ii) handle sequences of arbitrarily interleaved visual and textual data, and (iii) seamlessly ingest images or videos as inputs. Thanks to their flexibility, Flamingo models can be trained on large-scale multimodal web corpora containing arbitrarily interleaved text and images, which is key to endow them with in-context few-shot learning capabilities. We perform a thorough evaluation of our models, exploring and measuring their ability to rapidly adapt to a variety of image and video tasks. These include open-ended tasks such as visual question-answering, where the model is prompted with a question which it has to answer; captioning tasks, which evaluate the ability to describe a scene or an event; and close-ended tasks such as multiple-choice visual question-answering. For tasks lying anywhere on this spectrum, a single Flamingo model can achieve a new state of the art with few-shot learning, simply by prompting the model with task-specific examples. On numerous benchmarks, Flamingo outperforms models fine-tuned on thousands of times more task-specific data.},

Deep reinforcement learning algorithms are also applied to robotics, allowing control policies for robots to be learned directly from camera inputs in the real world. In this survey, we begin with an introduction to the general field of reinforcement learning, then progress to the main streams of value-based and policybased methods. Our survey will cover central algorithms in deep reinforcement learning, including the deep Q-network, trust region policy optimisation, and asynchronous advantage actor-critic. In parallel, we highlight the unique advantages of deep neural networks, focusing on visual understanding via reinforcement learning. To conclude, we describe several current areas of research within the field.},

  abstract = {Background: Real-time detection of drinking could improve timely delivery of interventions aimed at reducing alcohol consumption and alcohol-related injury, but existing detection methods are burdensome or impractical. Objective: To evaluate whether phone sensor data and machine learning models are useful to detect alcohol use events, and to discuss implications of these results for just-in-time mobile interventions. Methods: 38 non-treatment seeking young adult heavy drinkers downloaded AWARE app (which continuously collected mobile phone sensor data), and reported alcohol consumption (number of drinks, start/end time of prior day's drinking) for 28 days. We tested various machine learning models using the 20 most informative sensor features to classify time periods as non-drinking, low-risk (1 to 3/4 drinks per occasion for women/men), and high-risk drinking ({$>$} 4/5 drinks per occasion for women/men). Results: Among 30 participants in the analyses, 207 non-drinking, 41 low-risk, and 45 high-risk drinking episodes were reported. A Random Forest model using 30-min windows with 1 day of historical data performed best for detecting high-risk drinking, correctly classifying high-risk drinking windows 90.9\% of the time. The most informative sensor features were related to time (i.e., day of week, time of day), movement (e.g., change in activities), device usage (e.g., screen duration), and communication (e.g., call duration, typing speed). Conclusions: Preliminary evidence suggests that sensor data captured from mobile phones of young adults is useful in building accurate models to detect periods of high-risk drinking. Interventions using mobile phone sensor features could trigger delivery of a range of interventions to potentially improve effectiveness.},

Specifically, TSR contains two technologies, namely, traffic sign classification (TSC) and traffic sign detection (TSD). However, the challenge of TSR is to ensure its efficiency, which means adequate accuracy, generalization, and speed in real-time by a computationally limited platform. In this paper, we will introduce a new efficient TSC network called ENet (efficient network) and a TSD network called EmdNet (efficient network using multiscale operation and depthwise separable convolution). We used data mining and multiscale operation to improve the accuracy and generalization ability and used depthwise separable convolution (DSC) to improve the speed. The resulting ENet possesses 0.9 M parameters (1/15 the parameters of the start-of-the-art method) while still achieving an accuracy of 98.6 \% on the German Traffic Sign Recognition benchmark (GTSRB). In addition, we design EmdNet' s backbone network according to the principles of ENet. The EmdNet with the SDD Framework possesses only 6.3 M parameters, which is similar to MobileNet's scale.},

Furthermore, realistic looking stickers applied by normal people as acts of vandalism are not studied to discover their potential risks as well the risk of optimizing the location of such realistic stickers to achieve the maximum performance drop.

Data from Biometric Monitoring Technologies (BioMeTs), including mHealth and wearables, can be transformed into digital biomarkers that act as indicators of health outcomes and can be used to diagnose and monitor a number of chronic diseases and conditions. There are many challenges faced by digital biomarker development, including a lack of regulatory oversight, limited funding opportunities, general mistrust of sharing personal data, and a shortage of open-source data and code. Further, the process of transforming data into digital biomarkers is computationally expensive, and standards and validation methods in digital biomarker research are lacking. Methods: In order to provide a collaborative, standardized space for digital biomarker research and validation, we present the first comprehensive, open-source software platform for end-to-end digital biomarker development: The Digital Biomarker Discovery Pipeline (DBDP). Results: Here, we detail the general DBDP framework as well as three robust modules within the DBDP that have been developed for specific digital biomarker discovery use cases. Conclusions: The clear need for such a platform will accelerate the DBDP's adoption as the industry standard for digital biomarker development and will support its role as the epicenter of digital biomarker collaboration and exploration.},

Using these new labels, we reassess the accuracy of recently proposed ImageNet classifiers, and find their gains to be substantially smaller than those reported on the original labels. Furthermore, we find the original ImageNet labels to no longer be the best predictors of this independently-collected set, indicating that their usefulness in evaluating vision models may be nearing an end. Nevertheless, we find our annotation procedure to have largely remedied the errors in the original labels, reinforcing ImageNet as a powerful benchmark for future research in visual recognition.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we present Google, a prototype of a large-scale search engine which makes heavy use of the structure present in hypertext. Google is designed to crawl and index the Web efficiently and produce much more satisfying search results than existing systems. The prototype with a full text and hyperlink database of at least 24 million pages is available at http://google.stanford.edu/ To engineer a search engine is a challenging task. Search engines index tens to hundreds of millions of web pages involving a comparable number of distinct terms. They answer tens of millions of queries every day. Despite the importance of large-scale search engines on the web, very little academic research has been done on them. Furthermore, due to rapid advance in technology and web proliferation, creating a web search engine today is very different from three years ago. This paper provides an in-depth description of our large-scale web search engine -- the first such detailed public description we know of to date. Apart from the problems of scaling traditional search techniques to data of this magnitude, there are new technical challenges involved with using the additional information present in hypertext to produce better search results. This paper addresses this question of how to build a practical large-scale system which can exploit the additional information present in hypertext. Also we look at the problem of how to effectively deal with uncontrolled hypertext collections where anyone can publish anything they want.},

Here we show that scaling up language models greatly improves task-agnostic, few-shot performance, sometimes even reaching competitiveness with prior state-of-the-art finetuning approaches. Specifically, we train GPT-3, an autoregressive language model with 175 billion parameters, 10x more than any previous non-sparse language model, and test its performance in the few-shot setting. For all tasks, GPT-3 is applied without any gradient updates or fine-tuning, with tasks and few-shot demonstrations specified purely via text interaction with the model. GPT-3 achieves strong performance on many NLP datasets, including translation, question-answering, and cloze tasks, as well as several tasks that require on-the-fly reasoning or domain adaptation, such as unscrambling words, using a novel word in a sentence, or performing 3-digit arithmetic. At the same time, we also identify some datasets where GPT-3's few-shot learning still struggles, as well as some datasets where GPT-3 faces methodological issues related to training on large web corpora. Finally, we find that GPT-3 can generate samples of news articles which human evaluators have difficulty distinguishing from articles written by humans.

In this study, we introduce InfoSeek, a visual question answering dataset tailored for information-seeking questions that cannot be answered with only common sense knowledge. Using InfoSeek, we analyze various pre-trained visual question answering models and gain insights into their characteristics. Our findings reveal that state-of-the-art pre-trained multi-modal models (e.g., PaLI-X, BLIP2, etc.) face challenges in answering visual information-seeking questions, but fine-tuning on the InfoSeek dataset elicits models to use fine-grained knowledge that was learned during their pre-training. Furthermore, we show that accurate visual entity recognition can be used to improve performance on InfoSeek by retrieving relevant documents, showing a significant space for improvement.},

  abstract = {Smartphones have become increasingly popular in recent years. However, it may be addiction-prone and result in negative outcomes. Given that relevant research remains limited, this study attempts to address two research gaps in the extant information systems literature. First, research on the determinants of smartphone addiction remains scarce. Second, the role of individual characteristics (i.e., gender) in the formation of smartphone addiction is far from clear. To fill these research gaps, this study develops a research model of smartphone addiction from the functionalist perspective and highlights the moderating role of gender with the insight of social orientation. We propose four categories of motives, including enhancement (i.e., perceived enjoyment), social (i.e., social relationship), coping (i.e., mood regulation and pastime), and conformity motives (i.e., conformity). Empirical results from our online survey illustrate that perceived enjoyment, mood regulation, pastime, and conformity positively affect smartphone addiction, whereas social relationship has no significant effect. Moreover, we find that gender moderates the effects of perceived enjoyment, pastime, and conformity on smartphone addiction. We expect that this study can enrich the theoretical understanding of how motives play different roles in the development of smartphone addiction. Implications are offered for both research and practice.},

This controversial topic has drawn great attention in public. However, we are still at a stage of divergent opinions without any definitive conclusion. Motivated by this, we raise the research question of ``is GPT-4 a good data analyst?'' in this work and aim to answer it by conducting head-to-head comparative studies. In detail, we regard GPT-4 as a data analyst to perform end-to-end data analysis with databases from a wide range of domains. We propose a framework to tackle the problems by carefully designing the prompts for GPT-4 to conduct experiments. We also design several task-specific evaluation metrics to systematically compare the performance between several professional human data analysts and GPT-4. Experimental results show that GPT-4 can achieve comparable performance to humans. We also provide in-depth discussions about our results to shed light on further studies before we reach the conclusion that GPT-4 can replace data analysts.

We present PaLI (Pathways Language and Image model), a model that extends this approach to the joint modeling of language and vision. PaLI generates text based on visual and textual inputs, and with this interface performs many vision, language, and multimodal tasks, in many languages. To train PaLI, we make use of large pre-trained encoder-decoder language models and Vision Transformers (ViTs). This allows us to capitalize on their existing capabilities and leverage the substantial cost of training them. We find that joint scaling of the vision and language components is important. Since existing Transformers for language are much larger than their vision counterparts, we train a large, 4-billion parameter ViT (ViT-e) to quantify the benefits from even larger-capacity vision models. To train PaLI, we create a large multilingual mix of pre-training tasks, based on a new image-text training set containing 10B images and texts in over 100 languages. PaLI achieves state-of-the-art in multiple vision and language tasks (such as captioning, visual question-answering, scene-text understanding), while retaining a simple, modular, and scalable design.},

  abstract = {While language tasks are naturally expressed in a single, unified, modeling framework, i.e., generating sequences of tokens, this has not been the case in computer vision. As a result, there is a proliferation of distinct architectures and loss functions for different vision tasks. In this work we show that a diverse set of ``core'' computer vision tasks can also be unified if formulated in terms of a shared pixelto-sequence interface. We focus on four tasks, namely, object detection, instance segmentation, keypoint detection, and image captioning, all with diverse types of outputs, e.g., bounding boxes or dense masks. Despite that, by formulating the output of each task as a sequence of discrete tokens with a unified interface, we show that one can train a neural network with a single model architecture and loss function on all these tasks, with no task-specific customization. To solve a specific task, we use a short prompt as task description, and the sequence output adapts to the prompt so it can produce task-specific output. We show that such a model can achieve competitive performance compared to well-established task-specific models.},

  abstract = {The limited availability of annotated data often hinders real-world applications of machine learning. To efficiently learn from small quantities of multimodal data, we leverage the linguistic knowledge from a large pre-trained language model (PLM) and quickly adapt it to new domains of image captioning. To effectively utilize a pretrained model, it is critical to balance the visual input and prior linguistic knowledge from pretraining. We propose VisualGPT, which employs a novel self-resurrecting encoderdecoder attention mechanism to quickly adapt the PLM with a small amount of in-domain image-text data. The proposed self-resurrecting activation unit produces sparse activations that prevent accidental overwriting of linguistic knowledge. When trained on 0.1\%, 0.5\% and 1\% of the respective training sets, VisualGPT surpasses the best baseline by up to 10.0\% CIDEr on MS COCO [45] and 17.9\% CIDEr on Conceptual Captions [69]. Furthermore, VisualGPT achieves the state-of-the-art result on IU X-ray [15], a medical report generation dataset. Our code is available at https://github.com/Vision-CAIR/ VisualGPT.},

We train a Transformer-based masked language model on one hundred languages, using more than two terabytes of filtered CommonCrawl data. Our model, dubbed XLM-R, significantly outperforms multilingual BERT (mBERT) on a variety of cross-lingual benchmarks, including +14.6\% average accuracy on XNLI, +13\% average F1 score on MLQA, and +2.4\% F1 score on NER. XLM-R performs particularly well on low-resource languages, improving 15.7\% in XNLI accuracy for Swahili and 11.4\% for Urdu over previous XLM models. We also present a detailed empirical analysis of the key factors that are required to achieve these gains, including the trade-offs between (1) positive transfer and capacity dilution and (2) the performance of high and low resource languages at scale. Finally, we show, for the first time, the possibility of multilingual modeling without sacrificing per-language performance; XLM-R is very competitive with strong monolingual models on the GLUE and XNLI benchmarks. We will make our code, data and models publicly available.},

  abstract = {State-of-the-art object detectors usually progressively downsample the input image until it is represented by small feature maps, which loses the spatial information and compromises the representation of small objects. In this article, we propose a context-aware block net (CAB Net) to improve small object detection by building high-resolution and strong semantic feature maps. To internally enhance the representation capacity of feature maps with high spatial resolution, we delicately design the context-aware block (CAB). CAB exploits pyramidal dilated convolutions to incorporate multilevel contextual information without losing the original resolution of feature maps. Then, we assemble CAB to the end of the truncated backbone network (e.g., VGG16) with a relatively small downsampling factor (e.g., 8) and cast off all following layers. CAB Net can capture both basic visual patterns as well as semantical information of small objects, thus improving the performance of small object detection. Experiments conducted on the benchmark Tsinghua-Tencent 100K and the Airport dataset show that CAB Net outperforms other top-performing detectors by a large margin while keeping real-time speed, which demonstrates the effectiveness of CAB Net for small object detection.},

  abstract = {Text data augmentation is an effective strategy for overcoming the challenge of limited sample sizes in many natural language processing (NLP) tasks. This challenge is especially prominent in the few-shot learning scenario, where the data in the target domain is generally much scarcer and of lowered quality. A natural and widely-used strategy to mitigate such challenges is to perform data augmentation to better capture the data invariance and increase the sample size. However, current text data augmentation methods either can't ensure the correct labeling of the generated data (lacking faithfulness) or can't ensure sufficient diversity in the generated data (lacking compactness), or both. Inspired by the recent success of large language models, especially the development of ChatGPT, which demonstrated improved language comprehension abilities, in this work, we propose a text data augmentation approach based on ChatGPT (named AugGPT). AugGPT rephrases each sentence in the training samples into multiple conceptually similar but semantically different samples. The augmented samples can then be used in downstream model training. Experiment results on few-shot learning text classification tasks show the superior performance of the proposed AugGPT approach over state-of-the-art text data augmentation methods in terms of testing accuracy and distribution of the augmented samples.},

  abstract = {Biosensors enable observation and understanding of latent physiological occurrences otherwise unknown or invasively detected. Wearable biosensors monitoring physiological constructs across a wide variety of mental and physical health conditions have become an important trend in innovative research methodologies. Within substance use research, explorations of biosensor technology commonly focus on identifying physiological indicators of intoxication to increase understanding of addiction etiology and to inform treatment recommendations. In this review, we examine the state of research in this area as it pertains to treatment of alcohol use disorders specifically highlighting the gaps in our current knowledge with recommendations for future research. Annually, alcohol use disorders affect approximately 15 million individuals. A primary focus of existing wearable technology-based research among people with alcohol use disorders is identifying alcohol intoxication. A large benefit of wearable biosensors for this purpose is they provide continuous readings in a passive manner compared with the gold standard measure of blood alcohol content (BAC) traditionally measured intermittently by breathalyzer or blood draw. There are two primary means of measuring intoxication with biosensors: gait and sweat. Gait changes have been measured via smart sensors placed on the wrist, in the shoe, and mobile device sensors in smart phones. Sweat measured by transdermal biosensors detects the presence of alcohol in the blood stream correlating to BAC. Transdermal biosensors have been designed in tattoos/skin patches, shirts, and most commonly, devices worn on the ankle or wrist. Transdermal devices were initially developed to help monitor court-ordered sobriety among offenders with alcohol use disorder. These devices now prove most useful in continuously tracking consumption throughout clinical trials for behavioral treatment modalities. More recent research has started exploring the uses for physical activity trackers and physiological arousal sensors to guide behavioral interventions for relapse prevention. While research has begun to demonstrate wearable devices' utility in reducing alcohol consumption among individuals aiming to cutdown on their drinking, monitoring sustained abstinence in studies exploring contingency management for alcohol use disorders, and facilitating engagement in activity-based treatment interventions, their full potential to further aid in understanding of, and treatment for, alcohol use disorders has yet to be explored.},

  abstract = {Feelings of well-being and happiness fluctuate over time and contexts. Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) studies can capture fluctuations in momentary behavior, and experiences by assessing these multiple times per day. Traditionally, EMA was performed using pen and paper. Recently, due to technological advances EMA studies can be conducted more easily with smartphones, a device ubiquitous in our society. The goal of this review was to evaluate the literature on smartphone-based EMA in well-being research in healthy subjects. The systematic review was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines. Searching PubMed and Web of Science, we identified 53 studies using smartphone-based EMA of wellbeing. Studies were heterogeneous in designs, context, and measures. The average study duration was 12.8 days, with well-being assessed 2--12 times per day. Half of the studies included objective data (e.g. location). Only 47.2\% reported compliance, indicating a mean of 71.6\%. Well-being fluctuated daily and weekly, with higher well-being in evenings and weekends. These fluctuations disappeared when location and activity were accounted for. On average, being in nature and physical activity relates to higher well-being. Working relates to lower well-being, but workplace and company do influence well-being. The important advantages of using smartphones instead of other devices to collect EMAs are the easier data collection and flexible designs. Smartphone-based EMA reach far larger maximum sample sizes and more easily add objective data to their designs than palm-top/ PDA studies. Smartphone-based EMA research is feasible to gain insight in well-being fluctuations and its determinants and offers the opportunity for parallel objective data collection. Most studies currently focus on group comparisons, while studies on individual differences in well-being patterns and fluctuations are lacking. We provide recommendations for future smartphone-based EMA research regarding measures, objective data and analyses.},

The dataset determines the quality of the complete visual system based on CNN. Unfortunately, databases for traffic signs from the majority of the world's nations are few. In this scenario, Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) may be employed to produce more realistic and varied training pictures to supplement the actual arrangement of images. The purpose of this research is to describe how the quality of synthetic pictures created by DCGAN, LSGAN, and WGAN is determined. Our work combines synthetic images with original images to enhance datasets and verify the effectiveness of synthetic datasets. We use different numbers and sizes of images for training. Likewise, the Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) and Mean Square Error (MSE) were employed to assess picture quality. Our study quantifies the SSIM difference between the synthetic and actual images. When additional images are used for training, the synthetic image exhibits a high degree of resemblance to the genuine image. The highest SSIM value was achieved when using 200 total images as input and 32 {\texttimes} 32 image size. Further, we augment the original picture dataset with synthetic pictures and compare the original image model to the synthesis image model. For this experiment, we are using the latest iterations of Yolo, Yolo V3, and Yolo V4. After mixing the real image with the synthesized image produced by LSGAN, the recognition performance has been improved, achieving an accuracy of 84.9\% on Yolo V3 and an accuracy of 89.33\% on Yolo V4.},

  abstract = {ChatGPT, a general-purpose text generation AI model, is reshaping various domains ranging from education and software development to legal defense and novel writing. Despite its potential impact, there is a lack of research on how ChatGPT might influence streaming media, which is an essential part of everyday entertainment. As a result, it remains unclear how ChatGPT is changing the future of streaming media. To bridge such a research gap, in this paper, we propose a crowdsourced, data-driven framework that leverages two social media platforms, Twitter and Reddit, to explore the impact of ChatGPT on streaming media. Through extensive analysis of social media data collected from Twitter and Reddit, we reveal how ChatGPT is transforming streaming media from diverse perspectives. Our data analytics demonstrates that ChatGPT is sparking both fear and excitement in the context of the streaming media and enhancing the downstream visual generative models, such as DALLE-2 and Stable Diffusion Videos. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first large-scale and systematical investigation into the effects of ChatGPT on streaming media. Hope our findings will inspire further research and discussions on this topic across academia and industry.},

  abstract = {The recent advancements in Artificial Intelligence, particularly in large language models and generative models, are reshaping the field of software engineering by enabling innovative ways of performing various tasks, such as programming, debugging, and testing. However, few existing works have thoroughly explored the potential of AI in code generation and users' attitudes toward AI-assisted coding tools. This knowledge gap leaves it unclear how AI is transforming software engineering and programming education. This paper presents a scalable crowdsourcing data-driven framework to investigate the code generation performance of generative large language models from diverse perspectives across multiple social media platforms. Specifically, we utilize ChatGPT, a popular generative large language model, as a representative example to reveal its insights and patterns in code generation. First, we propose a hybrid keyword word expansion method that integrates words suggested by topic modeling and expert knowledge to filter relevant social posts of interest on Twitter and Reddit. Then we collect 316K tweets and 3.2K Reddit posts about ChatGPT's code generation, spanning from Dec. 1, 2022 to January 31, 2023. Our data analytics show that ChatGPT has been used in more than 10 programming languages, with Python and JavaScript being the two most popular, for a diverse range of tasks such as code debugging, interview preparation, and academic assignment solving. Surprisingly, our analysis shows that fear is the dominant emotion associated with ChatGPT's code generation, overshadowing emotions of happiness, anger, surprise, and sadness. Furthermore, we construct a ChatGPT prompt and corresponding code dataset by analyzing the screenshots of ChatGPT code generation shared on social media. This dataset enables us to evaluate the quality of the generated code, and we have released this dataset to the public. We believe the insights gained from our work will provide valuable guidance for future research on AI-powered code generation.},

  abstract = {The Indoor Air Quality (IAQ) of the bedroom environment has recently garnered attention since air pollution can affect sleep. Previous studies investigated IAQ and sleep quality in controlled environments which impacts both self-reported and measured sleep quality. Studies within a participant's home environment are ecologically valid and reduce participant bias. Here, we study 20 participants over 77 days in Austin, TX. We monitored five components of IAQ using the BEVO Beacon, a calibrated purpose-built environmental monitor, and measured participant sleep quality through wearable activity trackers and 4-question surveys sent four times a week. We found significant decreases in sleep quality during nights with elevated CO, CO2, and temperature. Elevated CO was associated with a mean increase in 0.9 self-reported awakenings and decreases in device-measured sleep time of 21.6 min and sleep efficiency of 0.6\%. Increased CO2 and temperature were associated with decreases in device-measured sleep time of 17.5 and 15.2 min, respectively. Elevated PM2.5 and TVOCs concentrations were associated with overall improvements in sleep quality. Participants reported a mean of 4.4 fewer awakenings and had a 1.1\% increased in measured sleep efficiency for nights with elevated PM2.5. Elevated TVOCs were associated with an increase in sleep time of 14.5 min. These findings indicate a need to study the relationship between these aggregate IAQ measures and sleep quality more closely. Our results also indicate that pollutants can independently affect sleep quality regardless of the CO2 measurements. Compared to literature, our study is the longest and includes the most IAQ parameters.},

To address this gap, we develop and evaluate four Machine Learning (ML) models on two disparate datasets using Indoor Air Quality (IAQ) parameters as primary features and components of self-reported IAQ satisfaction and sleep quality as target variables. In each case, we compare models to each other as well as to a simple model that always predicts the majority outcome. In the first analysis, we use open-source data collected from 93 California residences to predict occupant's satisfaction with their indoor environ\- ment. Results indicate building ventilation rate, Relative Humidity (RH), and formaldehyde are most influential when predicting IAQ perception and do so with an accuracy greater than the simplified model. The second analysis uses IAQ data gathered from a field study we conducted with 20 participants over 11 weeks to train similar models. We obtain accuracy and F1 scores similar to the simplified model where PM2.5 and TVOCs represent the most important predictors. Our results underscore the ability of IAQ to affect a person's perception of their built environment and health and highlight the utility of ML models to explore the strength of these relationships.},

In the independent open coding phase, CollabCoder provides AI-generated code suggestions on demand, and allows users to record coding decision-making information (e.g. keywords and certainty) as support for the process. During the discussion phase, CollabCoder helps to build mutual understanding and productive discussion by sharing coding decision-making information with the team. It also helps to quickly identify agreements and disagreements through quantitative metrics, in order to build a final consensus. During the code grouping phase, CollabCoder employs a top-down approach for primary code group recommendations, reducing the cognitive burden of generating the final codebook. An evaluation involving 16 users confirmed the usability and effectiveness of CollabCoder and offered empirical insights into the LLMs' roles in CQA.},

  abstract = {Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated an impressive ability to perform arithmetic and symbolic reasoning tasks, when provided with a few examples at test time ("few-shot prompting"). Much of this success can be attributed to prompting methods such as "chain-of-thought'', which employ LLMs for both understanding the problem description by decomposing it into steps, as well as solving each step of the problem. While LLMs seem to be adept at this sort of step-by-step decomposition, LLMs often make logical and arithmetic mistakes in the solution part, even when the problem is decomposed correctly. In this paper, we present Program-Aided Language models (PAL): a novel approach that uses the LLM to read natural language problems and generate programs as the intermediate reasoning steps, but offloads the solution step to a runtime such as a Python interpreter. With PAL, decomposing the natural language problem into runnable steps remains the only learning task for the LLM, while solving is delegated to the interpreter. We demonstrate this synergy between a neural LLM and a symbolic interpreter across 13 mathematical, symbolic, and algorithmic reasoning tasks from BIG-Bench Hard and other benchmarks. In all these natural language reasoning tasks, generating code using an LLM and reasoning using a Python interpreter leads to more accurate results than much larger models. For example, PAL using Codex achieves state-of-the-art few-shot accuracy on the GSM8K benchmark of math word problems, surpassing PaLM-540B which uses chain-of-thought by absolute 15\% top-1.

In this paper, we recognize the difficulty of zero-shot learning and encoding relevance. Instead, we propose to pivot through Hypothetical Document Embeddings{\textasciitilde}(HyDE). Given a query, HyDE first zero-shot instructs an instruction-following language model (e.g. InstructGPT) to generate a hypothetical document. The document captures relevance patterns but is unreal and may contain false details. Then, an unsupervised contrastively learned encoder{\textasciitilde}(e.g. Contriever) encodes the document into an embedding vector. This vector identifies a neighborhood in the corpus embedding space, where similar real documents are retrieved based on vector similarity. This second step ground the generated document to the actual corpus, with the encoder's dense bottleneck filtering out the incorrect details. Our experiments show that HyDE significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art unsupervised dense retriever Contriever and shows strong performance comparable to fine-tuned retrievers, across various tasks (e.g. web search, QA, fact verification) and languages{\textasciitilde}(e.g. sw, ko, ja).},

  abstract = {Human intelligence excels at combining basic skills to solve complex tasks. This capability is vital for Artificial Intelligence (AI) and should be embedded in comprehensive intelligent models, enabling them to harness expert models for complex task-solving towards Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). Large Language Models (LLMs) show promising learning and reasoning abilities, and can effectively use external models, tools or APIs to tackle complex problems. In this work, we introduce OpenAGI, an open-source AGI research platform designed for multi-step, real-world tasks. Specifically, OpenAGI uses a dual strategy, integrating standard benchmark tasks for benchmarking and evaluation, and open-ended tasks including more expandable models, tools or APIs for creative problem-solving. Tasks are presented as natural language queries to the LLM, which then selects and executes appropriate models. We also propose a Reinforcement Learning from Task Feedback (RLTF) mechanism that uses task results to improve the LLM's ability, which creates a self-improving AI feedback loop. While we acknowledge that AGI is a broad and multifaceted research challenge with no singularly defined solution path, the integration of LLMs with domain-specific expert models, inspired by mirroring the blend of general and specialized intelligence in humans, offers a promising approach towards AGI. We are open-sourcing the OpenAGI project's code, dataset, benchmarks, evaluation methods, and demo to foster community involvement in AGI advancement: https://github.com/agiresearch/OpenAGI.},

The training procedure for G is to maximize the probability of D making a mistake. This framework corresponds to a minimax two-player game. In the space of arbitrary functions G and D, a unique solution exists, with G recovering the training data distribution and D equal to 1/2 everywhere. In the case where G and D are defined by multilayer perceptrons, the entire system can be trained with backpropagation. There is no need for any Markov chains or unrolled approximate inference networks during either training or generation of samples. Experiments demonstrate the potential of the framework through qualitative and quantitative evaluation of the generated samples.},

In this work, we propose a novel system that leverages the perception system on autonomous vehicle to identify occluded road signs in real time.

We analyze this dataset to (1) characterize the typical captions, (2) characterize the diversity of content found in the images, and (3) compare its content to that found in eight popular vision datasets.

This work surveys and extends recent research which demonstrates that randomization offers a powerful tool for performing low-rank matrix approximation. These techniques exploit modern computational architectures more fully than classical methods and open the possibility of dealing with truly massive data sets. This paper presents a modular framework for constructing randomized algorithms that compute partial matrix decompositions. These methods use random sampling to identify a subspace that captures most of the action of a matrix. The input matrix is then compressed---either explicitly or implicitly---to this subspace, and the reduced matrix is manipulated deterministically to obtain the desired low-rank factorization. In many cases, this approach beats its classical competitors in terms of accuracy, speed, and robustness. These claims are supported by extensive numerical experiments and a detailed error analysis.},

  abstract = {Transformer is a new kind of neural architecture which encodes the input data as powerful features via the attention mechanism. Basically, the visual transformers first divide the input images into several local patches and then calculate both representations and their relationship. Since natural images are of high complexity with abundant detail and color information, the granularity of the patch dividing is not fine enough for excavating features of objects in different scales and locations. In this paper, we point out that the attention inside these local patches are also essential for building visual transformers with high performance and we explore a new architecture, namely, Transformer iN Transformer (TNT). Specifically, we regard the local patches (e.g., 16{\texttimes}16) as ``visual sentences'' and present to further divide them into smaller patches (e.g., 4{\texttimes}4) as ``visual words''. The attention of each word will be calculated with other words in the given visual sentence with negligible computational costs. Features of both words and sentences will be aggregated to enhance the representation ability. Experiments on several benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed TNT architecture, e.g., we achieve an 81.5\% top-1 accuracy on the ImageNet, which is about 1.7\% higher than that of the state-of-the-art visual transformer with similar computational cost. The PyTorch code is available at https://github.com/huawei-noah/CV-Backbones, and the MindSpore code is available at https://gitee.com/mindspore/models/ tree/master/research/cv/TNT.},

  abstract = {The rise of big data has amplified the need for efficient, user-friendly automated machine learning (AutoML) tools. However, the intricacy of understanding domain-specific data and defining prediction tasks necessitates human intervention making the process time-consuming while preventing full automation. Instead, envision an intelligent agent capable of assisting users in conducting AutoML tasks through intuitive, natural conversations without requiring in-depth knowledge of the underlying machine learning (ML) processes. This agent's key challenge is to accurately comprehend the user's prediction goals and, consequently, formulate precise ML tasks, adjust data sets and model parameters accordingly, and articulate results effectively. In this paper, we take a pioneering step towards this ambitious goal by introducing a ChatGPT-based conversational data-science framework to act as a "personal data scientist". Precisely, we utilize Large Language Models (ChatGPT) to build a natural interface between the users and the ML models (Scikit-Learn), which in turn, allows us to approach this ambitious problem with a realistic solution. Our model pivots around four dialogue states: Data Visualization, Task Formulation, Prediction Engineering, and Result Summary and Recommendation. Each state marks a unique conversation phase, impacting the overall user-system interaction. Multiple LLM instances, serving as "micro-agents", ensure a cohesive conversation flow, granting us granular control over the conversation's progression. In summary, we developed an end-to-end system that not only proves the viability of the novel concept of conversational data science but also underscores the potency of LLMs in solving complex tasks. Interestingly, its development spotlighted several critical weaknesses in the current LLMs (ChatGPT) and highlighted substantial opportunities for improvement.},

Given the likely impact of this model on data science, through this perspective article, we seek to provide an overview of the potential opportunities and challenges associated with using ChatGPT in data science, provide readers with a snapshot of its advantages, and stimulate interest in its use for data science projects. The paper discusses how ChatGPT can assist data scientists in automating various aspects of their workflow, including data cleaning and preprocessing, model training, and result interpretation. It also highlights how ChatGPT has the potential to provide new insights and improve decision-making processes by analyzing unstructured data. We then examine the advantages of ChatGPT's architecture, including its ability to be fine-tuned for a wide range of language-related tasks and generate synthetic data. Limitations and issues are also addressed, particularly around concerns about bias and plagiarism when using ChatGPT. Overall, the paper concludes that the benefits outweigh the costs and ChatGPT has the potential to greatly enhance the productivity and accuracy of data science workflows and is likely to become an increasingly important tool for intelligence augmentation in the field of data science. ChatGPT can assist with a wide range of natural language processing tasks in data science, including language translation, sentiment analysis, and text classification. However, while ChatGPT can save time and resources compared to training a model from scratch, and can be fine-tuned for specific use cases, it may not perform well on certain tasks if it has not been specifically trained for them. Additionally, the output of ChatGPT may be difficult to interpret, which could pose challenges for decision-making in data science applications.},

In order to mitigate this problem, in this letter, we adopt random occlusion, a recently developed data augmentation (DA) method for training CNNs, in which the pixels of different rectangular spatial regions in the HSI are randomly occluded, generating training images with various levels of occlusion and reducing the risk of overfitting. Our results with two well-known HSIs reveal that the proposed method helps to achieve better classification accuracy with low computational cost.},

This large advance in the state of the art is enabled by our release of the new MAESTRO (MIDI and Audio Edited for Synchronous TRacks and Organization) dataset, composed of over 172 hours of virtuosic piano performances captured with fine alignment ({\textasciitilde}3 ms) between note labels and audio waveforms. The networks and the dataset together present a promising approach toward creating new expressive and interpretable neural models of music.},

We develop Perceiver AR, an autoregressive, modality-agnostic architecture which uses cross-attention to map long-range inputs to a small number of latents while also maintaining end-to-end causal masking. Perceiver AR can directly attend to over a hundred thousand tokens, enabling practical long-context density estimation without the need for hand-crafted sparsity patterns or memory mechanisms. When trained on images or music, Perceiver AR generates outputs with clear long-term coherence and structure.

Motivated by our observation that data augmentations can help with real-world distribution shifts, we also introduce a new data augmentation method which advances the state-of-the-art and outperforms models pretrained with 1000 times more labeled data. Overall we find that some methods consistently help with distribution shifts in texture and local image statistics, but these methods do not help with some other distribution shifts like geographic changes.

AndWellness, a personal data collection system, uses mobile phones to collect and analyze data from both active, triggered user experience samples and passive logging of onboard environmental sensors. The system includes an application that runs on Android based mobile phones, server software that manages deployments and acts as a central repository for data, and a dashboard front end for both participants and researchers to visualize incoming data in real-time. Our system has gone through testing by researchers in preparation for deployment with participants, and we describe an initial qualitative study plus several planned future studies to demonstrate how our system can be used to better understand a user's health related habits and observations.},

Objective: This paper sought out competencies for mobile technologies and/or an approach to define them. Methods: A scoping review was conducted to answer the following research question, ``What skills are needed for clinicians and trainees to provide quality care via mHealth, have they been published, and how can they be made measurable and reproducible to teach and assess them?'' The review was conducted in accordance with the 6-stage scoping review process starting with a keyword search in PubMed/Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online, APA PsycNET, Cochrane, EMBASE, PsycINFO, Web of Science, and Scopus. The literature search focused on keywords in 4 concept areas: (1) competencies, (2) mobile technologies, (3) telemedicine mode, and (4) health. Moreover, 2 authors independently, in parallel, screened the search results for potentially relevant studies based on titles and abstracts. The authors reviewed the full-text articles for final inclusion based on inclusion/exclusion criteria. Inclusion criteria were keywords used from concept area 1 (competencies) and 2 (mobile technologies) and either 3 (telemedicine mode) or 4 (health). Exclusion criteria included, but were not limited to, keywords used from a concept area in isolation, discussion of skills abstractly, outline or listing of what clinicians need without detail, and listing immeasurable behaviors.},

However, existing image classification benchmarks often evaluate recognition on a specific domain (e.g., outdoor images) or a specific task (e.g., classifying plant species), which falls short of evaluating whether pre-trained foundational models are universal visual recognizers. To address this, we formally present the task of Open-domain Visual Entity recognitioN (OVEN), where a model need to link an image onto a Wikipedia entity with respect to a text query. We construct OVEN-Wiki by re-purposing 14 existing datasets with all labels grounded onto one single label space: Wikipedia entities. OVEN challenges models to select among six million possible Wikipedia entities, making it a general visual recognition benchmark with the largest number of labels. Our study on state-of-the-art pre-trained models reveals large headroom in generalizing to the massive-scale label space. We show that a PaLI-based auto-regressive visual recognition model performs surprisingly well, even on Wikipedia entities that have never been seen during fine-tuning. We also find existing pretrained models yield different strengths: while PaLI-based models obtain higher overall performance, CLIP-based models are better at recognizing tail entities.},

A broad range of prior research has investigated the spatial component of this relationship, seeking to strengthen the representational power of a CNN by enhancing the quality of spatial encodings throughout its feature hierarchy. In this work, we focus instead on the channel relationship and propose a novel architectural unit, which we term the ``Squeeze-and-Excitation'' (SE) block, that adaptively recalibrates channel-wise feature responses by explicitly modelling interdependencies between channels. We show that these blocks can be stacked together to form SENet architectures that generalise extremely effectively across different datasets. We further demonstrate that SE blocks bring significant improvements in performance for existing state-of-the-art CNNs at slight additional computational cost. Squeeze-and-Excitation Networks formed the foundation of our ILSVRC 2017 classification submission which won first place and reduced the top-5 error to 2.251\%, surpassing the winning entry of 2016 by a relative improvement of {$\sim$}25\%.

These priors introduce helpful inductive biases, but also lock models to individual modalities. In this paper we introduce the Perceiver -- a model that builds upon Transformers and hence makes few architectural assumptions about the relationship between its inputs, but that also scales to hundreds of thousands of inputs, like ConvNets. The model leverages an asymmetric attention mechanism to iteratively distill inputs into a tight latent bottleneck, allowing it to scale to handle very large inputs. We show that this architecture is competitive with or outperforms strong, specialized models on classification tasks across various modalities: images, point clouds, audio, video, and video+audio. The Perceiver obtains performance comparable to ResNet-50 and ViT on ImageNet without 2D convolutions by directly attending to 50,000 pixels. It is also competitive in all modalities in AudioSet.},

Our model augments the Perceiver with a flexible querying mechanism that enables outputs of various sizes and semantics, doing away with the need for task-specific architecture engineering. The same architecture achieves strong results on tasks spanning natural language and visual understanding, multi-task and multi-modal reasoning, and StarCraft II. As highlights, Perceiver IO outperforms a Transformer-based BERT baseline on the GLUE language benchmark despite removing input tokenization and achieves state-of-the-art performance on Sintel optical flow estimation with no explicit mechanisms for multiscale correspondence.},

However, it is a challenging task because of the complex traffic sign scene and the small size of the target. In recent years, a number of convolutional neural network (CNN) based object detection methods have brought great progress to traffic sign detection. Considering the still high false detection rate, as well as the high time overhead and computational overhead, the effect is not satisfactory. Therefore, we employ lightweight network model YOLO v5 (You Only Look Once) as our work foundation. In this paper, we propose an improved YOLO v5 method by using balances feature pyramid structure and global context block to enhance the ability of feature fusion and feature extraction. To verify our proposed method, we have conducted a lot of comparative experiments on the challenging dataset Tsinghua-Tencent-100K (TT100K). The experimental results demonstrate that the mAP@.5 and mAP@.5:0.95 are improved by 1.9\% and 2.1\%, respectively.},

  abstract = {Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT) is a popular machine learning algorithm, and has quite a few effective implementations such as XGBoost and pGBRT. Although many engineering optimizations have been adopted in these implementations, the efficiency and scalability are still unsatisfactory when the feature dimension is high and data size is large. A major reason is that for each feature, they need to scan all the data instances to estimate the information gain of all possible split points, which is very time consuming. To tackle this problem, we propose two novel techniques: Gradient-based One-Side Sampling (GOSS) and Exclusive Feature Bundling (EFB). With GOSS, we exclude a significant proportion of data instances with small gradients, and only use the rest to estimate the information gain. We prove that, since the data instances with larger gradients play a more important role in the computation of information gain, GOSS can obtain quite accurate estimation of the information gain with a much smaller data size. With EFB, we bundle mutually exclusive features (i.e., they rarely take nonzero values simultaneously), to reduce the number of features. We prove that finding the optimal bundling of exclusive features is NP-hard, but a greedy algorithm can achieve quite good approximation ratio (and thus can effectively reduce the number of features without hurting the accuracy of split point determination by much). We call our new GBDT implementation with GOSS and EFB LightGBM. Our experiments on multiple public datasets show that, LightGBM speeds up the training process of conventional GBDT by up to over 20 times while achieving almost the same accuracy.},

As evidence, we use the latest advances in language modeling to build a single pre-trained QA model, UnifiedQA, that performs surprisingly well across 17 QA datasets spanning 4 diverse formats. UnifiedQA performs on par with 9 different models that were trained on individual datasets themselves. Even when faced with 12 unseen datasets of observed formats, UnifiedQA performs surprisingly well, showing strong generalization from its out-of-format training data.

In this paper, we propose PRESTU, a novel pre-training recipe dedicated to scene-text understanding (STU). PRESTU introduces OCR-aware pre-training objectives that encourage the model to recognize text from an image and connect it to the rest of the image content. We implement PRESTU using a simple transformer-based encoder-decoder architecture, combined with large-scale image-text datasets with scene text obtained from an off-theshelf OCR system. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of this pre-training approach on eight visual question answering and four image captioning benchmarks.},

Our contributions are two-fold. First, we show that a reparameterization of the variational lower bound yields a lower bound estimator that can be straightforwardly optimized using standard stochastic gradient methods. Second, we show that for i.i.d. datasets with continuous latent variables per datapoint, posterior inference can be made especially efficient by fitting an approximate inference model (also called a recognition model) to the intractable posterior using the proposed lower bound estimator.

  abstract = {Abstract                            Background:               Chronic stress responses can lead to physical and behavioural health problems, often experienced and observed in the care of people with intellectual disabilities or people with dementia. Electrodermal activity (EDA) is a bio-signal for stress, which can be measured by wearables and thereby support stress management. However, the how, when and to what extent patients and healthcare providers can benefit is unclear. This study aims to create an overview of available wearables enabling the detection of perceived stress by using EDA.                                         Methods:               Following the PRISMA-SCR protocol for scoping reviews, four databases were included in the search of peer-reviewed studies published between 2012 and 2022, reporting detection of EDA in relation to self-reported stress or stress-related behaviours. Type of wearable, bodily location, research population, context, stressor type and the reported relationship between EDA and perceived stress were extracted.                                         Results:               Of the 74 included studies, the majority included healthy subjects in laboratory situations. Field studies and studies using machine learning (ML) to predict stress have increased in the last years. EDA is most often measured on the wrist, with offline data processing. Studies predicting perceived stress or stress-related behaviour using EDA features, reported accuracies between 42\% and 100\% with an average of 82.6\%. Of these studies, the majority used ML.                                         Conclusion:               Wearable EDA sensors are promising in detecting perceived stress. Field studies with relevant populations in a health or care context are lacking. Future studies should focus on the application of EDA-measuring wearables in real-life situations to support stress management.},

We provide an integrated pipeline that solves these issues by transforming all modalities to the same time unit, applying temporal independent component analysis (ICA) to high-dimensional modalities, and fusing the modalities with linear mixed-effects models. We applied our approach to integrate high-quality, daily self-report data with BiAffect keyboard dynamics derived from a clinical suicidality sample of mental health outpatients. Applying the ICA to the self-report data (104 participants, 5712 days of data) revealed components related to well-being, anhedonia, and irritability and social dysfunction. Mixed-effects models (55 participants, 1794 days) showed that less phone movement while typing was associated with more anhedonia ({$\beta$}\,=\,-0.12,               p               \,=\,0.00030).

A prototypical example of this is the one-shot learning setting, in which we must correctly make predictions given only a single example of each new class. In this paper, we explore a method for learning siamese neural networks which employ a unique structure to naturally rank similarity between inputs. Once a network has been tuned, we can then capitalize on powerful discriminative features to generalize the predictive power of the network not just to new data, but to entirely new classes from unknown distributions. Using a convolutional architecture, we are able to achieve strong results which exceed those of other deep learning models with near state-of-the-art performance on one-shot classification tasks.},

To make training faster, we used non-saturating neurons and a very efficient GPU implementation of the convolution operation. To reduce overfitting in the fully connected layers we employed a recently developed regularization method called "dropout" that proved to be very effective.

The objective is to integrate data and physics seamlessly without the need of employing elaborate and computationally taxing data assimilation schemes. However, preprocessing, problem formulation, code generation, postprocessing and analysis are still timeconsuming and may prevent SciML from wide applicability in industrial applications and in digital twin frameworks. Here, we integrate the various stages of SciML under the umbrella of ChatGPT, to formulate MyCrunchGPT, which plays the role of a conductor orchestrating the entire workflow of SciML based on simple prompts by the user. Specifically, we present two examples that demonstrate the potential use of MyCrunchGPT in optimizing airfoils in aerodynamics, and in obtaining flow fields in various geometries in interactive mode, with emphasis on the validation stage. To demonstrate the flow of the MyCrunchGPT, and create an infrastructure that can facilitate a broader vision, we built a webapp based guided user interface, that includes options for a comprehensive summary report. The overall objective is to extend MyCrunchGPT to handle diverse problems in computational mechanics, design, optimization and controls, and general scientific computing tasks involved in SciML, hence using it as a research assistant tool but also as an educational tool. While here the examples focus in fluid mechanics, future versions will target solid mechanics and materials science, geophysics, systems biology and bioinformatics.},

  author = {{Laurens van der Maaten}},
  abstract = {We present a new technique called ``t-SNE'' that visualizes high-dimensional data by giving each datapoint a location in a two or three-dimensional map. The technique is a variation of Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (Hinton and Roweis, 2002) that is much easier to optimize, and produces significantly better visualizations by reducing the tendency to crowd points together in the center of the map. t-SNE is better than existing techniques at creating a single map that reveals structure at many different scales. This is particularly important for high-dimensional data that lie on several different, but related, low-dimensional manifolds, such as images of objects from multiple classes seen from multiple viewpoints. For visualizing the structure of very large data sets, we show how t-SNE can use random walks on neighborhood graphs to allow the implicit structure of all of the data to influence the way in which a subset of the data is displayed. We illustrate the performance of t-SNE on a wide variety of data sets and compare it with many other non-parametric visualization techniques, including Sammon mapping, Isomap, and Locally Linear Embedding. The visualiza- tions produced by t-SNE are significantly better than those produced by the other techniques on almost all of the data sets.}

However, their ability to access and precisely manipulate knowledge is still limited, and hence on knowledge-intensive tasks, their performance lags behind task-specific architectures. Additionally, providing provenance for their decisions and updating their world knowledge remain open research problems. Pre-trained models with a differentiable access mechanism to explicit non-parametric memory can overcome this issue, but have so far been only investigated for extractive downstream tasks. We explore a general-purpose fine-tuning recipe for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) -- models which combine pre-trained parametric and non-parametric memory for language generation. We introduce RAG models where the parametric memory is a pre-trained seq2seq model and the non-parametric memory is a dense vector index of Wikipedia, accessed with a pre-trained neural retriever. We compare two RAG formulations, one which conditions on the same retrieved passages across the whole generated sequence, the other can use different passages per token. We fine-tune and evaluate our models on a wide range of knowledge-intensive NLP tasks and set the state-of-the-art on three open domain QA tasks, outperforming parametric seq2seq models and task-specific retrieve-and-extract architectures. For language generation tasks, we find that RAG models generate more specific, diverse and factual language than a state-of-the-art parametric-only seq2seq baseline.},

However, most existing pre-trained models only excel in either understanding-based tasks or generation-based tasks.

In this paper, we propose BLIP, a new VLP framework which transfers flexibly to both vision-language understanding and generation tasks. BLIP effectively utilizes the noisy web data by bootstrapping the captions, where a captioner generates synthetic captions and a filter removes the noisy ones. We achieve state-of-the-art results on a wide range of vision-language tasks, such as image-text retrieval (+2.7\% in average recall@1), image captioning (+2.8\% in CIDEr), and VQA (+1.6\% in VQA score). BLIP also demonstrates strong generalization ability when directly transferred to videolanguage tasks in a zero-shot manner. Code, models, and datasets are released.},

It has only recently been possible to extend protein structure prediction to two hundred million cataloged proteins. Characterizing the structures of the exponentially growing billions of protein sequences revealed by large scale gene sequencing experiments would necessitate a break-through in the speed of folding. Here we show that direct inference of structure from primary sequence using a large language model enables an order of magnitude speed-up in high resolution structure prediction. Leveraging the insight that language models learn evolutionary patterns across millions of sequences, we train models up to 15B parameters, the largest language model of proteins to date. As the language models are scaled they learn information that enables prediction of the three-dimensional structure of a protein at the resolution of individual atoms. This results in prediction that is up to 60x faster than state-of-the-art while maintaining resolution and accuracy. Building on this, we present the ESM Metage-nomic Atlas. This is the first large-scale structural characterization of metagenomic proteins, with more than 617 million structures. The atlas reveals more than 225 million high confidence predictions, including millions whose structures are novel in comparison with experimentally determined structures, giving an unprecedented view into the vast breadth and diversity of the structures of some of the least understood proteins on earth.},

  abstract = {Feature pyramids are a basic component in recognition systems for detecting objects at different scales. But recent deep learning object detectors have avoided pyramid representations, in part because they are compute and memory intensive. In this paper, we exploit the inherent multi-scale, pyramidal hierarchy of deep convolutional networks to construct feature pyramids with marginal extra cost. A topdown architecture with lateral connections is developed for building high-level semantic feature maps at all scales. This architecture, called a Feature Pyramid Network (FPN), shows significant improvement as a generic feature extractor in several applications. Using FPN in a basic Faster R-CNN system, our method achieves state-of-the-art singlemodel results on the COCO detection benchmark without bells and whistles, surpassing all existing single-model entries including those from the COCO 2016 challenge winners. In addition, our method can run at 5 FPS on a GPU and thus is a practical and accurate solution to multi-scale object detection. Code will be made publicly available.},

  abstract = {The realm of data science, once reserved for specialists, is undergoing a revolution with the rapid emergence of generative AI, particularly through tools like ChatGPT. This paper posits ChatGPT as a pivotal bridge, drastically lowering the steep learning curve traditionally associated with complex data analysis. By generating intuitive data narratives and offering real-time assistance, ChatGPT democratizes the field, enabling a wider audience to glean insights from intricate datasets. A notable illustration of this transformative potential is provided through the examination of a synthetically generated telematics dataset, wherein ChatGPT aids in distilling complex patterns and insights. However, the journey to democratization is not without its hurdles. The paper delves into challenges presented by such AI, from potential biases in analysis to ChatGPT's limited reasoning capabilities. While the promise of a democratized data science landscape beckons, it is imperative to approach this transition with caution, cognizance, and an ever-evolving understanding of the tool's capabilities and constraints.},

  abstract = {Traffic sign recognition is critical for advanced driver assistant system and road infrastructure survey. Traditional traffic sign recognition algorithms can't efficiently recognize traffic signs due to its limitation, yet deep learning-based technique requires huge amount of training data before its use, which is time consuming and labor intensive. In this study, transfer learning-based method is introduced for traffic sign recognition and classification, which significantly reduces the amount of training data and alleviates computation expense using Inception-v3 model. In our experiment, Belgium Traffic Sign Database is chosen and augmented by data pre-processing technique. Subsequently the layer-wise features extracted using different convolution and pooling operations are compared and analyzed. Finally transfer learning-based model is repetitively retrained several times with fine-tuning parameters at different learning rate, and excellent reliability and repeatability are observed based on statistical analysis. The results show that transfer learning model can achieve a high-level recognition performance in traffic sign recognition, which is up to 99.18 \% of recognition accuracy at 0.05 learning rate (average accuracy of 99.09 \%). This study would be beneficial in other traffic infrastructure recognition such as road lane marking and roadside protection facilities, and so on.},

As the first key step of TSR, traffic sign detection (TSD) is a challenging problem because of different types, small sizes, complex driving scenes, and occlusions. In recent years, there have been a large number of TSD algorithms based on machine vision and pattern recognition. In this paper, a comprehensive review of the literature on TSD is presented. We divide the reviewed detection methods into five main categories: color-based methods, shape-based methods, color- and shape-based methods, machine-learning-based methods, and LIDAR-based methods. The methods in each category are also classified into different subcategories for understanding and summarizing the mechanisms of different methods. For some reviewed methods that lack comparisons on public datasets, we reimplemented part of these methods for comparison. The experimental comparisons and analyses are presented on the reported performance and the performance of our reimplemented methods. Furthermore, future directions and recommendations of the TSD research are given to promote the development of the TSD.},

  abstract = {Small traffic sign recognition is a challenging problem in computer vision, and its accuracy is important to the safety of intelligent transportation systems (ITS). In this paper, we propose the multiscale region-based convolutional neural network (MR-CNN). At the detection stage, MR-CNN uses a multiscale deconvolution operation to up-sample the features of the deeper convolution layers and concatenates them to those of the shallow layer to construct the fused feature map. The fused feature map has the ability to generate fewer region proposals and achieve higher recall values. At the classification stage, we leverage the multi-scale contextual regions to exploit the information surrounding a given object proposal and construct the fused feature for the fully connected layers. The fused feature map inside the region proposal network (RPN) focuses primarily on improving the image resolution and semantic information for small traffic sign detection, while outside the RPN, the fused feature enhances the feature representation by leveraging the contextual information. Finally, we evaluated MR-CNN on the largest dataset, TsinghuaTencent 100K, which is suitable for our problem and more challenging than the GTSDB and GTSRB datasets. The final experimental results indicate that the MR-CNN is superior at detecting small traffic signs, and that it achieves the state-of-the-art performance compared with other methods.},

  abstract = {Traffic sign detection and recognition in the wild is a challenging task. Existing techniques are often incapable of detecting small or occluded traffic signs because of the scale variation and context loss, which causes semantic gaps between multiple scales. We propose a new traffic sign detection network (TSingNet), which learns scale-aware and context-rich features to effectively detect and recognize small and occluded traffic signs in the wild. Specifically, TSingNet first constructs an attention-driven bilateral feature pyramid network, which draws on both bottom-up and top-down subnets to dually circulate low-, mid-, and high-level foreground semantics in scale self-attention learning. This is to learn scaleaware foreground features and thus narrow down the semantic gaps between multiple scales. An adaptive receptive field fusion block with variable dilation rates is then introduced to exploit context-rich representation and suppress the influence of occlusion at each scale. TSingNet is end-to-end trainable by joint minimization of the scale-aware loss and multi-branch fusion losses, this adds a few parameters but significantly improves the detection performance. In extensive experiments with three challenging traffic sign datasets (TT100K, STSD and DFG), TSingNet outperformed state-of-the-art methods for traffic sign detection and recognition in the wild.},

  abstract = {Traditional camera sensors rely on human eyes for observation. However, the human eye is prone to fatigue when observing targets of different sizes for a long time in complex scenes, and human cognition is limited, which often leads to judgment errors and greatly reduces the efficiency. Target recognition technology is an important technology to judge the target category in camera sensor. In order to solve this problem, a small size target detection algorithm for special scenarios was proposed by this paper. Its advantage is that this algorithm not only has higher precision for small size target detection, but also can ensure that the detection accuracy of each size is not lower than the existing algorithm. In this paper, a new down-sampling method was proposed, which could better preserve the context feature information. The feature fusion network was improved to effectively combine shallow information and deep information. A new network structure was proposed to effectively improve the detection accuracy of the model. In terms of accuracy, it is better than: YOLOX, YOLOXR, YOLOv3, scaled YOLOv5, YOLOv7-Tiny and YOLOv8.Three authoritative public data sets were used in this experiment: a) On Visdron data sets (small size targets), DC-YOLOv8 is 2.5\% more accurate than YOLOv8. b) On Tinyperson data sets (minimal size targets), DC-YOLOv8 is 1\% more accurate than YOLOv8. c) On PASCAL VOC2007 data sets (Normal size target), DC-YOLOv8 is 0.5\% more accurate than YOLOv8.},

Vaccination has been identified as a key strategy to reduce the risk of severe illness and death among health care workers, but the effectiveness of vaccination in preventing hospitalization among health care workers is not well understood. Methods: We used a simulated data set of 100\,000 health care workers to estimate the effect of vaccination on the risk of hospitalization among health care workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. The data set included information on the health care workers' ages, body mass index (BMI), and number of comorbidities. We simulated infections with a small probability of hospitalization due to COVID-19 and a subset of individuals were vaccinated with a fictional vaccine that reduced the risk of hospitalization after infection. We performed a survival analysis using the Cox proportional hazards model to estimate the hazard ratio of hospitalization among vaccinated health care workers compared with unvaccinated health care workers. Results: The hazard ratio (HR) for vaccination status was 0.48 (95\% confidence interval [CI] 0.28-0.86), indicating that the risk of hospitalization among vaccinated health care workers was about half that of unvaccinated health care workers. Other covariates in the model did not have a statistically significant effect on the hazard of hospitalization. Conclusion: Our study indicates that vaccination is associated with a significantly reduced risk of hospitalization among health care workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. These results support the use of vaccination as a key strategy to reduce the risk of severe illness and death among health care workers.},

  abstract = {The field of data visualisation has long aimed to devise solutions for generating visualisations directly from natural language text. Research in Natural Language Interfaces (NLIs) has contributed towards the development of such techniques. However, the implementation of workable NLIs has always been challenging due to the inherent ambiguity of natural language, as well as in consequence of unclear and poorly written user queries which pose problems for existing language models in discerning user intent. Instead of pursuing the usual path of developing new iterations of language models, this study uniquely proposes leveraging the advancements in pre-trained large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT and GPT-3 to convert free-form natural language directly into code for appropriate visualisations. This paper presents a novel system, Chat2VIS, which takes advantage of the capabilities of LLMs and demonstrates how, with effective prompt engineering, the complex problem of language understanding can be solved more efficiently, resulting in simpler and more accurate end-to-end solutions than prior approaches. Chat2VIS shows that LLMs together with the proposed prompts offer a reliable approach to rendering visualisations from natural language queries, even when queries are highly misspecified and underspecified. This solution also presents a significant reduction in costs for the development of NLI systems, while attaining greater visualisation inference abilities compared to traditional NLP approaches that use hand-crafted grammar rules and tailored models. This study also presents how LLM prompts can be constructed in a way that preserves data security and privacy while being generalisable to different datasets. This work compares the performance of GPT-3, Codex and ChatGPT across several case studies and contrasts the performances with prior studies.},

Our new dataset includes more than 14,000 questions that require external knowledge to answer. We show that the performance of the state-of-the-art VQA models degrades drastically in this new setting. Our analysis shows that our knowledge-based VQA task is diverse, difficult, and large compared to previous knowledgebased VQA datasets.

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES To examine the directional associations among motor activity, energy, mood, and sleep using mobile monitoring in a community-identified sample, and to evaluate whether these within-day associations differ between people with a history of bipolar or other mood disorders and controls without mood disorders. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This study used a nested case-control design of 242 adults, a subsample of a community-based sample of adults. Probands were recruited by mail from the greater Washington, DC, metropolitan area from January 2005 to June 2013. Enrichment of the sample for mood disorders was provided by volunteers or referrals from the National Institutes of Health Clinical Center or by participants in the National Institute of Mental Health Mood and Anxiety Disorders Program. The inclusion criteria were the ability to speak English, availability to participate, and consent to contact at least 2 living first-degree relatives. Data analysis was performed from June 2013 through July 2018. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Motor activity and sleep duration data were obtained from minute-to-minute activity counts from an actigraphy device worn on the nondominant wrist for 2 weeks. Mood and energy levels were assessed by subjective analogue ratings on the ecological momentary assessment (using a personal digital assistant) by participants 4 times per day for 2 weeks. RESULTS Of the total 242 participants, 92 (38.1\%) were men and 150 (61.9\%) were women, with a mean (SD) age of 48 (16.9) years. Among the participants, 54 (22.3\%) had bipolar disorder (25 with bipolar I; 29 with bipolar II), 91 (37.6\%) had major depressive disorder, and 97 (40.1\%) were controls with no history of mood disorders. A unidirectional association was found between motor activity and subjective mood level ({$\beta$} = --0.018, P = .04). Bidirectional associations were observed between motor activity ({$\beta$} = 0.176; P = .03) and subjective energy level ({$\beta$} = 0.027; P = .03) as well as between motor activity ({$\beta$} = --0.027; P = .04) and sleep duration ({$\beta$} = --0.154; P = .04). Greater cross-domain reactivity was observed in bipolar disorder across all outcomes, including motor activity, sleep, mood, and energy. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE These findings suggest that interventions focused on motor activity and energy may have greater efficacy than current approaches that target depressed mood; both active and passive tracking of multiple regulatory systems are important in designing therapeutic targets.},

  abstract = {This survey reviews works in which language models (LMs) are augmented with reasoning skills and the ability to use tools. The former is defined as decomposing a potentially complex task into simpler subtasks while the latter consists in calling external modules such as a code interpreter. LMs can leverage these augmentations separately or in combination via heuristics, or learn to do so from demonstrations. While adhering to a standard missing tokens prediction objective, such augmented LMs can use various, possibly non-parametric external modules to expand their context processing ability, thus departing from the pure language modeling paradigm. We therefore refer to them as Augmented Language Models (ALMs). The missing token objective allows ALMs to learn to reason, use tools, and even act, while still performing standard natural language tasks and even outperforming most regular LMs on several benchmarks. In this work, after reviewing current advance in ALMs, we conclude that this new research direction has the potential to address common limitations of traditional LMs such as interpretability, consistency, and scalability issues.},

We describe the annotation process of our dataset (each video is tagged with one action or activity label among 339 different classes), analyze its scale and diversity in comparison to other large-scale video datasets for action recognition, and report results of several baseline models addressing separately, and jointly, three modalities: spatial, temporal and auditory. The Moments in Time dataset, designed to have a large coverage and diversity of events in both visual and auditory modalities, can serve as a new challenge to develop models that scale to the level of complexity and abstract reasoning that a human processes on a daily basis.},

These summaries include contextual and semantic information describing the important high-level details (what, where, who and how) of the observed event and exclude background information that is deemed unimportant to the observer. With this in mind, the descriptions people generate for videos of different dynamic events can greatly improve our understanding of the key information of interest in each video. These descriptions can be captured in captions that provide expanded attributes for video labeling (e.g. actions/objects/scenes/sentiment/etc.) while allowing us to gain new insight into what people find important or necessary to summarize specific events. Existing caption datasets for video understanding are either small in scale or restricted to a specific domain. To address this, we present the Spoken Moments (S-MiT) dataset of 500k spoken captions each attributed to a unique short video depicting a broad range of different events. We collect our descriptions using audio recordings to ensure that they remain as natural and concise as possible while allowing us to scale the size of a large classification dataset. In order to utilize our proposed dataset, we present a novel Adaptive Mean Margin (AMM) approach to contrastive learning and evaluate our models on video/caption retrieval on multiple datasets. We show that our AMM approach consistently improves our results and that models trained on our Spoken Moments dataset generalize better than those trained on other video-caption datasets.},

TigerAware is developed to offer a generic and customizable tool, which allows researchers to create surveys to collect a wide range of data, including but not limited to question responses, on device sensor data, such as GPS data, and external sensor data, such as blood alcohol level from a Bluetooth breathalyzer. TigerAware is highly modular and uses advanced Web and mobile technologies to incorporate diverse data sources with a rich set of survey question types, requiring little development work by researchers for their individualized studies. TigerAware has been applied to a focus group and several pilot studies and shown excellent capabilities to be easily adapted and deployed for new types of data collection and analytics tasks and a wide range of research fields.},

  abstract = {Large language models (LLM) such as OpenAI's ChatGPT and GPT-3 offer unique testbeds for exploring the translation challenges of turning literacy into numeracy. Previous publicly-available transformer models from eighteen months prior and 1000 times smaller failed to provide basic arithmetic. The statistical analysis of four complex datasets described here combines arithmetic manipulations that cannot be memorized or encoded by simple rules. The work examines whether next-token prediction succeeds from sentence completion into the realm of actual numerical understanding. For example, the work highlights cases for descriptive statistics on in-memory datasets that the LLM initially loads from memory or generates randomly using python libraries. The resulting exploratory data analysis showcases the model's capabilities to group by or pivot categorical sums, infer feature importance, derive correlations, and predict unseen test cases using linear regression. To extend the model's testable range, the research deletes and appends random rows such that recall alone cannot explain emergent numeracy.},

  abstract = {Beiwe is a high-throughput data collection platform for smartphone-based digital phenotyping. It has been in development and use since 2013. Beiwe consists of two native front-end applications: one for Android (written in Java and Kotlin) and one for iOS (written in Swift and Objective-C). The Beiwe back-end, which is based on Amazon Web Services (AWS), has been implemented primarily in Python 3.6, but it also makes use of Django for ORM and Flask for API and web servers. It uses several AWS services, such as S3 for flat file storage, EC2 virtual servers for data processing, Elastic Beanstalk for orchestration, and RDS for PostgreSQL database engine. Most smartphone applications use software development kits (SDKs) that generate unvalidated behavioral summary measures using closed proprietary algorithms. These applications do not meet the high standards of reproducible science, and often require researchers to modify their scientific questions based on what data happens to be available. In contrast, Beiwe collects raw sensor and phone use data, and its data collection parameters can be customized to address specific scientific questions of interest. Collection of raw data also improves reproducibility of studies and enables re-analyses of data and pooling of data across studies. Every aspect of Beiwe data collection is fully customizable, including which sensors to sample, how frequently to sample them, whether to add Gaussian noise to GPS location, whether to use Wi-Fi or cellular data for uploads, how frequently to upload data, specification of surveys and their response options, and skip logic. All study settings are captured in a JSON-formatted configuration file, which can be exported from and imported to Beiwe to enhance transparency and reproducibility of studies.},

In this paper, we study the phenomenon of heavy drinking at night (4+ drinks for women or 5+ for men on a single evening), using a smartphone sensing dataset depicting about nightlife and drinking behaviors for 240 young adult participants. Our work has three contributions. First, we segment nights into moving and static episodes as anchors to aggregate mobile sensing features. Second, we show that young adults tend to be more mobile, have more activities, and attend more crowded areas outside home on heavy drinking nights compared to other nights. Third, we develop a machine learning framework to classify a given weekend night as involving heavy or non-heavy drinking, comparing automatically captured sensor features versus manually contributed contextual cues and images provided over the course of the night. Results show that a fully automatic approach with phone sensors results in an accuracy of 71\%. In contrast, manual input of context of drinking events results in an accuracy of 70\%; and visual features of manually contributed images produce an accuracy of 72\%. This suggests that automatic sensing is a competitive approach.},

They enable us to define a new benchmark for localization of textual entity mentions in an image. We present a strong baseline for this task that combines an image-text embedding, detectors for common objects, a color classifier, and a bias towards selecting larger objects. While our baseline rivals in accuracy more complex state-of-the-art models, we show that its gains cannot be easily parlayed into improvements on such tasks as image-sentence retrieval, thus underlining the limitations of current methods and the need for further research.},

We design multiple novel conditioning schemes and train SDXL on multiple aspect ratios. We also introduce a refinement model which is used to improve the visual fidelity of samples generated by SDXL using a post-hoc image-to-image technique.

We measure how often models can correctly answer all sub-problems but not generate the overall solution, a ratio we call the compositionality gap. We evaluate this ratio by asking multi-hop questions with answers that require composing multiple facts unlikely to have been observed together during pretraining. In the GPT-3 family of models, as model size increases we show that the single-hop question answering performance improves faster than the multi-hop performance does, therefore the compositionality gap does not decrease. This surprising result suggests that while more powerful models memorize and recall more factual knowledge, they show no corresponding improvement in their ability to perform this kind of compositional reasoning. We then demonstrate how elicitive prompting (such as chain of thought) narrows the compositionality gap by reasoning explicitly. We present a new method, self-ask, that further improves on chain of thought. In our method, the model explicitly asks itself (and answers) follow-up questions before answering the initial question. We finally show that self-ask's structured prompting lets us easily plug in a search engine to answer the follow-up questions, which additionally improves accuracy.},

Although large unlabeled text corpora are abundant, labeled data for learning these specific tasks is scarce, making it challenging for discriminatively trained models to perform adequately. We demonstrate that large gains on these tasks can be realized by generative pre-training of a language model on a diverse corpus of unlabeled text, followed by discriminative fine-tuning on each specific task. In contrast to previous approaches, we make use of task-aware input transformations during fine-tuning to achieve effective transfer while requiring minimal changes to the model architecture. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on a wide range of benchmarks for natural language understanding. Our general task-agnostic model outperforms discriminatively trained models that use architectures specifically crafted for each task, significantly improving upon the state of the art in 9 out of the 12 tasks studied. For instance, we achieve absolute improvements of 8.9\% on commonsense reasoning (Stories Cloze Test), 5.7\% on question answering (RACE), and 1.5\% on textual entailment (MultiNLI).},

We show that explicitly generating image representations improves image diversity with minimal loss in photorealism and caption similarity. Our decoders conditioned on image representations can also produce variations of an image that preserve both its semantics and style, while varying the non-essential details absent from the image representation. Moreover, the joint embedding space of CLIP enables language-guided image manipulations in a zero-shot fashion. We use diffusion models for the decoder and experiment with both autoregressive and diffusion models for the prior, finding that the latter are computationally more efficient and produce higher-quality samples.},

Here, we propose scaling a deep contextual language model with unsupervised learning to sequences spanning evolutionary diversity. We find that without prior knowledge, information emerges in the learned representations on fundamental properties of proteins such as secondary structure, contacts, and biological activity. We show the learned representations are useful across benchmarks for remote homology detection, prediction of secondary structure, long-range residue--residue contacts, and mutational effect. Unsupervised representation learning enables state-of-the-art supervised prediction of mutational effect and secondary structure and improves state-of-the-art features for long-range contact prediction.           ,              In the field of artificial intelligence, a combination of scale in data and model capacity enabled by unsupervised learning has led to major advances in representation learning and statistical generation. In the life sciences, the anticipated growth of sequencing promises unprecedented data on natural sequence diversity. Protein language modeling at the scale of evolution is a logical step toward predictive and generative artificial intelligence for biology. To this end, we use unsupervised learning to train a deep contextual language model on 86 billion amino acids across 250 million protein sequences spanning evolutionary diversity. The resulting model contains information about biological properties in its representations. The representations are learned from sequence data alone. The learned representation space has a multiscale organization reflecting structure from the level of biochemical properties of amino acids to remote homology of proteins. Information about secondary and tertiary structure is encoded in the representations and can be identified by linear projections. Representation learning produces features that generalize across a range of applications, enabling state-of-the-art supervised prediction of mutational effect and secondary structure and improving state-of-the-art features for long-range contact prediction.},

Additionally, their formulation allows for a guiding mechanism to control the image generation process without retraining. However, since these models typically operate directly in pixel space, optimization of powerful DMs often consumes hundreds of GPU days and inference is expensive due to sequential evaluations. To enable DM training on limited computational resources while retaining their quality and flexibility, we apply them in the latent space of powerful pretrained autoencoders. In contrast to previous work, training diffusion models on such a representation allows for the first time to reach a near-optimal point between complexity reduction and detail preservation, greatly boosting visual fidelity. By introducing cross-attention layers into the model architecture, we turn diffusion models into powerful and flexible generators for general conditioning inputs such as text or bounding boxes and high-resolution synthesis becomes possible in a convolutional manner. Our latent diffusion models (LDMs) achieve a new state of the art for image inpainting and highly competitive performance on various tasks, including unconditional image generation, semantic scene synthesis, and super-resolution, while significantly reducing computational requirements compared to pixel-based DMs. Code is available at https://github.com/CompVis/latent-diffusion .},

We use the length of the activity vector to represent the probability that the entity exists and its orientation to represent the instantiation parameters. Active capsules at one level make predictions, via transformation matrices, for the instantiation parameters of higher-level capsules. When multiple predictions agree, a higher level capsule becomes active. We show that a discrimininatively trained, multi-layer capsule system achieves state-of-the-art performance on MNIST and is considerably better than a convolutional net at recognizing highly overlapping digits. To achieve these results we use an iterative routing-by-agreement mechanism: A lower-level capsule prefers to send its output to higher level capsules whose activity vectors have a big scalar product with the prediction coming from the lower-level capsule.},

Imagen builds on the power of large transformer language models in understanding text and hinges on the strength of diffusion models in high-fidelity image generation. Our key discovery is that generic large language models (e.g. T5), pretrained on text-only corpora, are surprisingly effective at encoding text for image synthesis: increasing the size of the language model in Imagen boosts both sample fidelity and image-text alignment much more than increasing the size of the image diffusion model. Imagen achieves a new state-of-the-art FID score of 7.27 on the COCO dataset, without ever training on COCO, and human raters find Imagen samples to be on par with the COCO data itself in image-text alignment. To assess text-to-image models in greater depth, we introduce DrawBench, a comprehensive and challenging benchmark for text-to-image models. With DrawBench, we compare Imagen with recent methods including VQ-GAN+CLIP, Latent Diffusion Models, and DALL-E 2, and find that human raters prefer Imagen over other models in side-by-side comparisons, both in terms of sample quality and image-text alignment.

We introduce Toolformer, a model trained to decide which APIs to call, when to call them, what arguments to pass, and how to best incorporate the results into future token prediction. This is done in a self-supervised way, requiring nothing more than a handful of demonstrations for each API. We incorporate a range of tools, including a calculator, a Q\&A system, a search engine, a translation system, and a calendar. Toolformer achieves substantially improved zero-shot performance across a variety of downstream tasks, often competitive with much larger models, without sacrificing its core language modeling abilities.},

While there are abundant AI models available for different domains and modalities, they cannot handle complicated AI tasks. Considering large language models (LLMs) have exhibited exceptional ability in language understanding, generation, interaction, and reasoning, we advocate that LLMs could act as a controller to manage existing AI models to solve complicated AI tasks and language could be a generic interface to empower this. Based on this philosophy, we present HuggingGPT, a framework that leverages LLMs (e.g., ChatGPT) to connect various AI models in machine learning communities (e.g., Hugging Face) to solve AI tasks. Specifically, we use ChatGPT to conduct task planning when receiving a user request, select models according to their function descriptions available in Hugging Face, execute each subtask with the selected AI model, and summarize the response according to the execution results. By leveraging the strong language capability of ChatGPT and abundant AI models in Hugging Face, HuggingGPT is able to cover numerous sophisticated AI tasks in different modalities and domains and achieve impressive results in language, vision, speech, and other challenging tasks, which paves a new way towards artificial general intelligence 2.},

EMA aims to minimize recall bias, maximize ecological validity, and allow study of microprocesses that influence behavior in real-world contexts. EMA studies assess particular events in subjects' lives or assess subjects at periodic intervals, often by random time sampling, using technologies ranging from written diaries and telephones to electronic diaries and physiological sensors. We discuss the rationale for EMA, EMA designs, methodological and practical issues, and comparisons of EMA and recall data.

Current state-of-the-art methods quantify physical activity using ``activity counts,'' a measure which overlooks specific types of physical activities. We propose a walking recognition method for sub-second tri-axial accelerometer data, in which activity classification is based on the inherent features of walking: intensity, periodicity, and duration. We validate our method against 20 publicly available, annotated datasets on walking activity data collected at various body locations (thigh, waist, chest, arm, wrist). We demonstrate that our method can estimate walking periods with high sensitivity and specificity: average sensitivity ranged between 0.92 and 0.97 across various body locations, and average specificity for common daily activities was typically above 0.95. We also assess the method's algorithmic fairness to demographic and anthropometric variables and measurement contexts (body location, environment). Finally, we release our method as open-source software in Python and MATLAB.},

Although DNNs work well whenever large labeled training sets are available, they cannot be used to map sequences to sequences. In this paper, we present a general end-to-end approach to sequence learning that makes minimal assumptions on the sequence structure. Our method uses a multilayered Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) to map the input sequence to a vector of a fixed dimensionality, and then another deep LSTM to decode the target sequence from the vector. Our main result is that on an English to French translation task from the WMT'14 dataset, the translations produced by the LSTM achieve a BLEU score of 34.8 on the entire test set, where the LSTM's BLEU score was penalized on out-of-vocabulary words. Additionally, the LSTM did not have difficulty on long sentences. For comparison, a phrase-based SMT system achieves a BLEU score of 33.3 on the same dataset. When we used the LSTM to rerank the 1000 hypotheses produced by the aforementioned SMT system, its BLEU score increases to 36.5, which is close to the previous best result on this task. The LSTM also learned sensible phrase and sentence representations that are sensitive to word order and are relatively invariant to the active and the passive voice. Finally, we found that reversing the order of the words in all source sentences (but not target sentences) improved the LSTM's performance markedly, because doing so introduced many short term dependencies between the source and the target sentence which made the optimization problem easier.},

To date, there seems to be still no consensus on what the right architecture and pre-training setup should be. This paper presents a unified framework for pre-training models that are universally effective across datasets and setups. We begin by disentangling architectural archetypes with pre-training objectives -- two concepts that are commonly conflated. Next, we present a generalized and unified perspective for self-supervision in NLP and show how different pre-training objectives can be cast as one another and how interpolating between different objectives can be effective. We then propose Mixture-of-Denoisers (MoD), a pre-training objective that combines diverse pre-training paradigms together. We furthermore introduce a notion of mode switching, wherein downstream fine-tuning is associated with specific pre-training schemes. We conduct extensive ablative experiments to compare multiple pre-training objectives and find that our method pushes the Pareto-frontier by outperforming T5 and/or GPT-like models across multiple diverse setups. Finally, by scaling our model up to 20B parameters, we achieve SOTA performance on 50 well-established supervised NLP tasks ranging from language generation (with automated and human evaluation), language understanding, text classification, question answering, commonsense reasoning, long text reasoning, structured knowledge grounding and information retrieval. Our model also achieve strong results at in-context learning, outperforming 175B GPT-3 (published paper results) on zero-shot SuperGLUE and tripling the performance of T5-XXL on one-shot summarization. On zero-shot MMLU, UL2 20B outperforms T0 and T5 models. Additionally, we show that UL2 20B works well with chain-of-thought prompting and reasoning, making it an appealing choice for research into reasoning at a small to medium scale of 20B parameters. Finally, we apply FLAN instruction tuning to the UL2 20B model, achieving MMLU and Big-Bench scores competitive to FLAN-PaLM 62B. We release Flax-based T5X model checkpoints for the UL2 20B model and Flan-UL2 20B model at https://github.com/google-research/google-research/tree/master/ul2.},

Existing traffic sign datasets are limited in terms of type and severity of challenging conditions. Metadata corresponding to these conditions are unavailable and it is not possible to investigate the effect of a single factor because of simultaneous changes in numerous conditions. To overcome the shortcomings in existing datasets, we introduced the CURE-TSDReal dataset, which is based on simulated challenging conditions that correspond to adversaries that can occur in real-world environments and systems. We test the performance of two benchmark algorithms and show that severe conditions can result in an average performance degradation of 29\% in precision and 68\% in recall. We investigate the effect of challenging conditions through spectral analysis and show that challenging conditions can lead to distinct magnitude spectrum characteristics. Moreover, we show that mean magnitude spectrum of changes in video sequences under challenging conditions can be an indicator of detection performance.

  abstract = {Visual question answering (VQA) is a hallmark of vision and language reasoning and a challenging task under the zero-shot setting. We propose Plug-and-Play VQA (PNP-VQA), a modular framework for zero-shot VQA. In contrast to most existing works, which require substantial adaptation of pretrained language models (PLMs) for the vision modality, PNPVQA requires no additional training of the PLMs. Instead, we propose to use natural language and network interpretation as an intermediate representation that glues pretrained models together. We first generate questionguided informative image captions, and pass the captions to a PLM as context for question answering. Surpassing end-to-end trained baselines, PNP-VQA achieves state-of-the-art results on zero-shot VQAv2 (Goyal et al., 2017) and GQA (Hudson and Manning, 2019). With 11B parameters, it outperforms the 80Bparameter Flamingo model (Alayrac et al., 2022) by 8.5\% on VQAv2. With 738M PLM parameters, PNP-VQA achieves an improvement of 9.1\% on GQA over FewVLM (Jin et al., 2022) with 740M PLM parameters.},

  abstract = {Background Smartwatch and fitness band wearable consumer electronics can passively measure pulse rate from the wrist using photoplethysmography (PPG). Identification of pulse irregularity or variability from these data has the potential to identify atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter (AF, collectively). The rapidly expanding consumer base of these devices allows for detection of undiagnosed AF at scale. Methods The Apple Heart Study is a prospective, single arm pragmatic study that has enrolled 419,093 participants (NCT03335800). The primary objective is to measure the proportion of participants with an irregular pulse detected by the Apple Watch (Apple Inc, Cupertino, CA) with AF on subsequent ambulatory ECG patch monitoring. The secondary objectives are to: 1) characterize the concordance of pulse irregularity notification episodes from the Apple Watch with simultaneously recorded ambulatory ECGs; 2) estimate the rate of initial contact with a health care provider within 3 months after notification of pulse irregularity. The study is conducted virtually, with screening, consent and data collection performed electronically from within an accompanying smartphone app. Study visits are performed by telehealth study physicians via video chat through the app, and ambulatory ECG patches are mailed to the participants. Conclusions The results of this trial will provide initial evidence for the ability of a smartwatch algorithm to identify pulse irregularity and variability which may reflect previously unknown AF. The Apple Heart Study will help provide a foundation for how wearable technology can inform the clinical approach to AF identification and screening. (Am Heart J 2019;207:66-75.)},

Acquiring labels without observers is challenging and previous solutions compromised ecological validity, range of behaviors, or amount of data. Our user interface combines past and near-future self-reporting of combinations of relevant context-labels. We deployed the app on the personal smartphones of 60 users and analyzed quantitative data collected in-the-wild and qualitative user-experience reports. The interface's flexibility was important to gain frequent, detailed labels, support diverse behavioral situations, and engage different users: most preferred reporting their past behavior through a daily journal, but some preferred reporting what they're about to do. We integrated insights from this work back into the app, which we make available to researchers for conducting in-the-wild studies.},

Due to recent progress in object detection, attribute classification, action recognition, etc., there is renewed interest in this area. However, evaluating the quality of descriptions has proven to be challenging. We propose a novel paradigm for evaluating image descriptions that uses human consensus. This paradigm consists of three main parts: a new triplet-based method of collecting human annotations to measure consensus, a new automated metric (CIDEr) that captures consensus, and two new datasets: PASCAL-50S and ABSTRACT-50S that contain 50 sentences describing each image. Our simple metric captures human judgment of consensus better than existing metrics across sentences generated by various sources. We also evaluate five state-of-the-art image description approaches using this new protocol and provide a benchmark for future comparisons. A version of CIDEr named CIDErD is available as a part of MS COCO evaluation server to enable systematic evaluation and benchmarking.},

  abstract = {Smartphone and wearable devices are widely used in behavioral and clinical research to collect longitudinal data that, along with ground truth data, are used to create models of human behavior. Mobile sensing researchers often program data processing and analysis code from scratch even though many research teams collect data from similar mobile sensors, platforms, and devices. This leads to significant inefficiency in not being able to replicate and build on others' work, inconsistency in quality of code and results, and lack of transparency when code is not shared alongside publications. We provide an overview of Reproducible Analysis Pipeline for Data Streams (RAPIDS), a reproducible pipeline to standardize the preprocessing, feature extraction, analysis, visualization, and reporting of data streams coming from mobile sensors. RAPIDS is formed by a group of R and Python scripts that are executed on top of reproducible virtual environments, orchestrated by a workflow management system, and organized following a consistent file structure for data science projects. We share open source, documented, extensible and tested code to preprocess, extract, and visualize behavioral features from data collected with any Android or iOS smartphone sensing app as well as Fitbit and Empatica wearable devices. RAPIDS allows researchers to process mobile sensor data in a rigorous and reproducible way. This saves time and effort during the data analysis phase of a project and facilitates sharing analysis workflows alongside publications.},

However it is unknown whether language models, trained on sequences of natural proteins, will be capable of more than memorization of existing protein families. Here we show that language models generalize beyond natural proteins to generate             de novo             proteins. We focus on two protein design tasks: fixed backbone design where the structure is specified, and unconstrained generation where the structure is sampled from the model. Remarkably although the models are trained only on sequences, we find that they are capable of designing structure. A total of 228 generated proteins are evaluated experimentally with high overall success rates (152/228 or 67\%) in producing a soluble and monomeric species by size exclusion chromatography. Out of 152 experimentally successful designs, 35 have no significant sequence match to known natural proteins. Of the remaining 117, sequence identity to the nearest sequence match is at median 27\%, below 20\% for 6 designs, and as low as 18\% for 3 designs. For fixed backbone design, the language model generates successful designs for each of eight experimentally evaluated artificially created fixed backbone targets. For unconstrained generation, sampled proteins cover diverse topologies and secondary structure compositions, and have high experimental success rate (71/129 or 55\%). The designs reflect deep patterns linking sequence and structure, including motifs that occur in related natural structures, and motifs that are not observed in similar structural contexts in known protein families. The results show that language models, though only trained on sequences, learn a deep grammar that enables the design of protein structure, extending beyond natural proteins.},

HOPES is based on the open-source Beiwe platform but adds a wider range of data collection, including the integration of wearable devices and further sensor collection from smartphones. Requirements were partly derived from a concurrent clinical trial for schizophrenia that required the development of significant capabilities in HOPES for security, privacy, ease of use, and scalability, based on a careful combination of public cloud and on-premises operation. We describe new data pipelines to clean, process, present, and analyze data. This includes a set of dashboards customized to the needs of research study operations and clinical care.

Intuitively, our networks are forced to discard predictive signals such as color and texture that can be gleaned from local receptive fields and to rely instead on the global structures of the image. Across a battery of synthetic and benchmark domain adaptation tasks, our method confers improved generalization out of the domain. Also, to evaluate cross-domain transfer, we introduce ImageNet-Sketch, a new dataset consisting of sketch-like images, that matches the ImageNet classification validation set in categories and scale.},

Summarizing mobile screens requires a holistic understanding of the multi-modal data of mobile UIs, including text, image, structures as well as UI semantics, motivating our multi-modal learning approach. We collected and analyzed a large-scale screen summarization dataset annotated by human workers. Our dataset contains more than 112k language summarization across \${\textbackslash}sim\$22k unique UI screens. We then experimented with a set of deep models with different configurations. Our evaluation of these models with both automatic accuracy metrics and human rating shows that our approach can generate high-quality summaries for mobile screens. We demonstrate potential use cases of Screen2Words and open-source our dataset and model to lay the foundations for further bridging language and user interfaces.},

  abstract = {With recent progress in joint modeling of visual and textual representations, Vision-Language Pretraining (VLP) has achieved impressive performance on many multimodal downstream tasks. However, the requirement for expensive annotations including clean image captions and regional labels limits the scalability of existing approaches, and complicates the pretraining procedure with the introduction of multiple dataset-specific objectives. In this work, we relax these constraints and present a minimalist pretraining framework, named Simple Visual Language Model (SimVLM). Unlike prior work, SimVLM reduces the training complexity by exploiting large-scale weak supervision, and is trained end-to-end with a single prefix language modeling objective. Without utilizing extra data or task-specific customization, the resulting model significantly outperforms previous pretraining methods and achieves new state-of-the-art results on a wide range of discriminative and generative vision-language benchmarks, including VQA (+3.74\% vqa-score), NLVR2 (+1.17\% accuracy), SNLI-VE (+1.37\% accuracy) and image captioning tasks (+10.1\% average CIDEr score). Furthermore, we demonstrate that SimVLM acquires strong generalization and transfer ability, enabling zero-shot behavior including open-ended visual question answering and cross-modality transfer.},

Chatbots are functionally helping in several things such as curriculum information, admission for new students, schedule info for any lecture courses, students grade information, and some adding features for Muslim worships schedule, also weather forecast information. This Chatbot is developed by deep learning models, which was adopted by an artificial intelligence model that replicates human intelligence with some specific training schemes. This kind of deep learning is based on RNN which has some specific memory savings scheme for the deep learning model, specifically this chatbot using LSTM which already integrates by RASA framework. LSTM is also known as Long Short Term Memory which efficiently saves some required memory but will remove some memory that is not needed.

A number of human-subject studies have been conducted to examine the use of mobile sensing to uncover individual behavioral patterns and health outcomes, yet minimal attention has been placed on measuring living environments together with other human-centered sensing data. Moreover, the participant sample size in most existing studies falls well below a few hundred, leaving questions open about the reliability of findings on the relations between mobile sensing signals and human outcomes.                                         Results               To address these limitations, we developed a home environment sensor kit for continuous indoor air quality tracking and deployed it in conjunction with smartphones, Fitbits, and ecological momentary assessments in a cohort study of up to 1,584 college student participants per data type for 3 weeks. We propose a conceptual framework that systematically organizes human-centric data modalities by their temporal coverage and spatial freedom. Then we report our study procedure, technologies and methods deployed, and descriptive statistics of the collected data that reflect the participants' mood, sleep, behavior, and living environment.                                         Conclusions               We were able to collect from a large participant cohort satisfactorily complete multi-modal sensing and survey data in terms of both data continuity and participant adherence. Our novel data and conceptual development provide important guidance for data collection and hypothesis generation in future human-centered sensing studies.},

Based on the dataset, we set up multi-choice and open-ended QA tasks targeting causal action reasoning, temporal action reasoning, and common scene comprehension. Through extensive analysis of baselines and established VideoQA techniques, we find that top-performing methods excel at shallow scene descriptions but are weak in causal and temporal action reasoning. Furthermore, the models that are effective on multi-choice QA, when adapted to open-ended QA, still struggle in generalizing the answers. This raises doubt on the ability of these models to reason and highlights possibilities for improvement. With detailed results for different question types and heuristic observations for future works, we hope NExT-QA will guide the next generation of VQA research to go beyond superficial scene description towards a deeper understanding of videos.

However, this process is often labor-intensive, particularly when working with large datasets. While recent AI-based tools demonstrate utility, researchers may not have readily available AI resources and expertise, let alone be challenged by the limited generalizability of those task-specific models. In this study, we explored the use of large language models (LLMs) in supporting deductive coding, a major category of qualitative analysis where researchers use pre-determined codebooks to label the data into a fixed set of codes. Instead of training task-specific models, a pre-trained LLM could be used directly for various tasks without fine-tuning through prompt learning. Using a curiosity-driven questions coding task as a case study, we found, by combining GPT-3 with expert-drafted codebooks, our proposed approach achieved fair to substantial agreements with expert-coded results. We lay out challenges and opportunities in using LLMs to support qualitative coding and beyond.},

We evaluate different types of sequence-based methods for each task including traditional feature engineering approaches, different sequence encoding methods as well as large-scale pre-trained protein language models. In addition, we also investigate the performance of these methods under the multi-task learning setting. Experimental results show that large-scale pre-trained protein language models achieve the best performance for most individual tasks, and jointly training multiple tasks further boosts the performance.

In each optimization step, the LLM generates new solutions from the prompt that contains previously generated solutions with their values, then the new solutions are evaluated and added to the prompt for the next optimization step. We first showcase OPRO on linear regression and traveling salesman problems, then move on to prompt optimization where the goal is to find instructions that maximize the task accuracy. With a variety of LLMs, we demonstrate that the best prompts optimized by OPRO outperform human-designed prompts by up to 8\% on GSM8K, and by up to 50\% on Big-Bench Hard tasks.},

In this paper, we explore the use of LLMs to generate both reasoning traces and task-specific actions in an interleaved manner, allowing for greater synergy between the two: reasoning traces help the model induce, track, and update action plans as well as handle exceptions, while actions allow it to interface with and gather additional information from external sources such as knowledge bases or environments. We apply our approach, named ReAct, to a diverse set of language and decision making tasks and demonstrate its effectiveness over state-of-the-art baselines in addition to improved human interpretability and trustworthiness. Concretely, on question answering (HotpotQA) and fact verification (Fever), ReAct overcomes prevalent issues of hallucination and error propagation in chain-of-thought reasoning by interacting with a simple Wikipedia API, and generating human-like task-solving trajectories that are more interpretable than baselines without reasoning traces. Furthermore, on two interactive decision making benchmarks (ALFWorld and WebShop), ReAct outperforms imitation and reinforcement learning methods by an absolute success rate of 34\% and 10\% respectively, while being prompted with only one or two in-context examples.},

The current mainstream detection methods have high accuracy in this task, but the number of model parameters is large, and the detection speed is slow. Based on YOLOv5s as the basic framework, this paper proposes YOLOv5S-A2, which can improve the detection speed and reduce the model size at the cost of reducing the detection accuracy. Firstly, a data augmentation strategy is proposed by combining various operations to alleviate the problem of unbalanced class instances. Secondly, we proposed a path aggregation module for Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) to make new horizontal connections. It can enhance multi-scale feature representation capability and compensate for the loss of feature information. Thirdly, an attention detection head module is proposed to solve the aliasing effect in cross-scale fusion and enhance the representation of predictive features. Experiments on Tsinghua-Tencent 100K dataset (TT100K) show that our method can achieve more remarkable performance improvement and faster inference speed than other advanced technologies. Our method achieves 87.3\% mean average precision (mAP), surpassing the original model's 7.9\%, and the frames per second (FPS) value is maintained at 87.7. To show generality, we tested it on the German Traffic Sign Detection Benchmark (GTSDB) without tuning and obtained an average precision of 94.1\%, and the FPS value is maintained at about 105.3. In addition, the number of YOLOv5s-A2 parameters is about 7.9 M.},

  abstract = {Exploring large-scale pretrained foundation models is of significant interest in computer vision because these models can be quickly transferred to many downstream tasks. This paper presents Contrastive Captioner (CoCa), a minimalist design to pretrain an image-text encoder-decoder foundation model jointly with contrastive loss and captioning loss, thereby subsuming model capabilities from contrastive approaches like CLIP and generative methods like SimVLM. In contrast to standard encoder-decoder transformers where all decoder layers attend to encoder outputs, CoCa omits cross-attention in the first half of decoder layers to encode unimodal text representations, and cascades the remaining decoder layers which cross-attend to the image encoder for multimodal image-text representations. We apply a contrastive loss between unimodal image and text embeddings, in addition to a captioning loss on the multimodal decoder outputs which predicts text tokens autoregressively. By sharing the same computational graph, the two training objectives are computed efficiently with minimal overhead. CoCa is pretrained end-to-end and from scratch on both web-scale alt-text data and annotated images by treating all labels simply as text, seamlessly unifying natural language supervision for representation learning. Empirically, CoCa achieves state-of-theart performance with zero-shot transfer or minimal task-specific adaptation on a broad range of downstream tasks, spanning visual recognition (ImageNet, Kinetics400/600/700, Moments-in-Time), crossmodal retrieval (MSCOCO, Flickr30K, MSR-VTT), multimodal understanding (VQA, SNLI-VE, NLVR2), and image captioning (MSCOCO, NoCaps). Notably on ImageNet classification, CoCa obtains 86.3\% zero-shot top-1 accuracy, 90.6\% with a frozen encoder and learned classification head, and new state-of-the-art 91.0\% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet with a finetuned encoder.},

In this exploratory study, we used various machine learning algorithms to build models to predict the amount of cannabis smoked since participants' last report including forty-three EMA measures of mood, impulsivity, pain, alcohol use, cigarette use, craving, cannabis potency, cannabis use motivation, subjective effects of cannabis, social context, and location in daily life. Results: Our best-fitting model (Gradient Boosted Trees; 71.15\% accuracy, 72.46\% precision) found that affects, subjective effects of cannabis, and cannabis use motives were among the best predictors of cannabis use amount in daily life. The social context of being with others, and particularly with a partner or friend, was moderately weighted in the final prediction model, but contextual items reflecting location were not strongly weighted in the final prediction model, the one exception being not at work. Conclusions: Machine learning approaches can help identify additional environmental and psychological phe\- nomena that may be clinically-relevant to cannabis use.},

Therefore, it is significant to elucidate the inter-individual and intraindividual influences along with contextual influences that predict the use of cannabis. TigerAware is a mobile survey data collection platform that holds unique promise to advance research in addiction and substance use. This paper presents a novel method to support Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) studies. We propose to extract useful information from TigerAware survey data using data mining and machine learning methods, and structure customizable survey analyses into reproducible workflows. Through our analysis pipeline for EMA, researchers are able to discover meaningful information from survey data with minimal duplication of effort and improve the efficiency and rigor of the process.},

  abstract = {We present the Pathways Autoregressive Text-to-Image (Parti) model, which generates high-fidelity photorealistic images and supports content-rich synthesis involving complex compositions and world knowledge. Parti treats text-to-image generation as a sequence-to-sequence modeling problem, akin to machine translation, with sequences of image tokens as the target outputs rather than text tokens in another language. This strategy can naturally tap into the rich body of prior work on large language models, which have seen continued advances in capabilities and performance through scaling data and model sizes. Our approach is simple: First, Parti uses a Transformer-based image tokenizer, ViT-VQGAN, to encode images as sequences of discrete tokens. Second, we achieve consistent quality improvements by scaling the encoder-decoder Transformer model up to 20B parameters, with a new state-of-the-art zero-shot FID score of 7.23 and finetuned FID score of 3.22 on MS-COCO. Our detailed analysis on Localized Narratives as well as PartiPrompts (P2), a new holistic benchmark of over 1600 English prompts, demonstrate the effectiveness of Parti across a wide variety of categories and difficulty aspects. We also explore and highlight limitations of our models in order to define and exemplify key areas of focus for further improvements. See https://parti.research.google/ for high-resolution images.},

  abstract = {Vision language pre-training aims to learn alignments between vision and language from a large amount of data. Most existing methods only learn image-text alignments. Some others utilize pre-trained object detectors to leverage vision language alignments at the object level. In this paper, we propose to learn multigrained vision language alignments by a unified pre-training framework that learns multi-grained aligning and multi-grained localization simultaneously. Based on it, we present X2-VLM, an all-in-one model with a flexible modular architecture, in which we further unify image-text pre-training and video-text pre-training in one model. X2-VLM is able to learn unlimited visual concepts associated with diverse text descriptions. Experiment results show that X2-VLM performs the best on base and large scale for both image-text and video-text tasks, making a good trade-off between performance and model scale. Moreover, we show that the modular design of X2-VLM results in high transferability for it to be utilized in any language or domain. For example, by simply replacing the text encoder with XLM-R, X2-VLM outperforms state-of-the-art multilingual multi-modal pre-trained models without any multilingual pre-training. The code and pre-trained models are available at github.com/zengyan-97/X2-VLM.},

Scale is a primary ingredient in attaining excellent results, therefore, understanding a model's scaling properties is a key to designing future generations effectively. While the laws for scaling Transformer language models have been studied, it is unknown how Vision Transformers scale. To address this, we scale ViT models and data, both up and down, and characterize the relationships between error rate, data, and compute. Along the way, we refine the architecture and training of ViT, reducing memory consumption and increasing accuracy of the resulting models. As a result, we successfully train a ViT model with two billion parameters, which attains a new state-of-the-art on ImageNet of 90.45\% top-1 accuracy. The model also performs well for few-shot transfer, for example, reaching 84.86\% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet with only 10 examples per class.},

  abstract = {AI tasks encompass a wide range of domains and fields. While numerous AI models have been designed for specific tasks and applications, they often require considerable human efforts in finding the right model architecture, optimization algorithm, and hyperparameters. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT show remarkable capabilities in various aspects of reasoning, comprehension, and interaction. Consequently, we propose developing task-oriented prompts and automatically utilizing LLMs to automate the training pipeline. To implement this concept, we present the AutoML-GPT, which employs GPT as the bridge to diverse AI models and dynamically trains models with optimized hyperparameters. AutoML-GPT dynamically takes user requests from the model and data cards and composes the corresponding prompt paragraph. Ultimately, with this prompt paragraph, AutoML-GPT will automatically conduct the experiments from data processing to model architecture, hyperparameter tuning, and predicted training log. By leveraging AutoML-GPT's robust language capabilities and the available AI models, AutoML-GPT can tackle numerous intricate AI tasks across various tasks and datasets. This approach achieves remarkable results in computer vision, natural language processing, and other challenging areas. Extensive experiments and ablation studies demonstrate that our method can be general, effective, and beneficial for many AI tasks.},

The advancements in large language models (LLMs) have made it possible to interact with tables using natural language input, bringing this capability closer to reality. In this paper, we present TableGPT, a unified fine-tuned framework that enables LLMs to understand and operate on tables using external functional commands. It introduces the capability to seamlessly interact with tables, enabling a wide range of functionalities such as question answering, data manipulation (e.g., insert, delete, query, and modify operations), data visualization, analysis report generation, and automated prediction. TableGPT aims to provide convenience and accessibility to users by empowering them to effortlessly leverage tabular data. At the core of TableGPT lies the novel concept of global tabular representations, which empowers LLMs to gain a comprehensive understanding of the entire table beyond meta-information. By jointly training LLMs on both table and text modalities, TableGPT achieves a deep understanding of tabular data and the ability to perform complex operations on tables through chain-of-command instructions. Importantly, TableGPT offers the advantage of being a self-contained system rather than relying on external API interfaces. Moreover, it supports efficient data process flow, query rejection (when appropriate) and private deployment, enabling faster domain data fine-tuning and ensuring data privacy, which enhances the framework's adaptability to specific use cases.},

In other domains such as learning from non-structural data like texts and images, reasoning on extracted structures (like the dependency trees of sentences and the scene graphs of images) is an important research topic which also needs graph reasoning models. Graph neural networks (GNNs) are neural models that capture the dependence of graphs via message passing between the nodes of graphs. In recent years, variants of GNNs such as graph convolutional network (GCN), graph attention network (GAT), graph recurrent network (GRN) have demonstrated ground-breaking performances on many deep learning tasks. In this survey, we propose a general design pipeline for GNN models and discuss the variants of each component, systematically categorize the applications, and propose four open problems for future research.},

We make two contributions to this problem. Firstly, we have created a large traffic-sign benchmark from 100000 Tencent Street View panoramas, going beyond previous benchmarks. It provides 100000 images containing 30000 traffic-sign instances. These images cover large variations in illuminance and weather conditions. Each traffic-sign in the benchmark is annotated with a class label, its bounding box and pixel mask. We call this benchmark Tsinghua-Tencent 100K. Secondly, we demonstrate how a robust end-to-end convolutional neural network (CNN) can simultaneously detect and classify trafficsigns. Most previous CNN image processing solutions target objects that occupy a large proportion of an image, and such networks do not work well for target objects occupying only a small fraction of an image like the traffic-signs here. Experimental results show the robustness of our network and its superiority to alternatives. The benchmark, source code and the CNN model introduced in this paper is publicly available1.},
